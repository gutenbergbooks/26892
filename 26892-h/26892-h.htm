<p>The locomotive chase in Georgia, which forms
what may be called the background of this story,
was an actual occurrence of the great Civil War.
But I wish to emphasize the fact that the following
pages belong to the realm of fiction. Some
of the incidents, and the character of Andrews,
are historic, whilst other incidents and characters
are imaginary. The reader who would like to
procure an account of the chase as it really happened
should consult the narrative of the Reverend
William Pittenger. Mr. Pittenger took part
in the expedition organized by Andrews, and his
record of it is a graphic contribution to the annals
of the conflict between North and South.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>HAZARDOUS PLANS</h3>
</div>

<p>The lightning flashes, the mutterings of thunder,
like the low growls of some angry animal,
and the shrieking of the wind through swaying
branches, gave a weird, uncanny effect to a scene
which was being enacted, on a certain April
night of the year 1862, in a secluded piece of
woodland a mile or more east of the village of
Shelbyville, Tennessee. In the centre of a small
clearing hemmed in by trees stood a tall, full-bearded
man of distinguished bearing. Around
him were grouped twenty sturdy fellows who
listened intently, despite the stir of the elements,
to something that he was saying in a low, serious
tone of voice. None of them, strangely enough,
wore a uniform, although they were all loyal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Union soldiers belonging to the division of
troops commanded by General O. M. Mitchell,
then encamped on the banks of Duck River,
only a couple of miles away. For the country
was now engaged in the life-and-death struggle
of the Civil War, when Northerner fought
against Southerner&mdash;sometimes brother against
brother&mdash;and no one could predict whether the
result would be a divided or a reunited nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; the speaker was solemnly saying,
as a new flash from the darkened heavens
lit up the landscape for a second, and showed
how resolute were the lines of his face; &#8220;my
friends, if you go into this scheme with me, you
are taking your lives into your hands. It&#8217;s only
fair that I should impress this upon you, and
give any and all of you a chance to drop
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a quick, sharp clap of thunder,
which was not loud enough, however, to drown
the earnest protest of every listener. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not cowards, Andrews!&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll stick to you
through thick and thin!&#8221; &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to
draw back!&#8221; These were among the fervent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
answers which greeted the leader addressed as
Andrews. The latter was evidently pleased,
though by no means surprised. He was dealing
with brave men, and he knew his audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the better, boys,&#8221; he went on, with a
complacent ring in his soft but penetrating
voice. &#8220;You see, this is the situation. The
Confederates are concentrating at Corinth, Mississippi,
and Generals Grant and Buell are advancing
by different routes against them. Now,
our own General Mitchell finds himself in a
position to press into East Tennessee as far as
possible, and he hopes soon to seize Chattanooga,
after he has taken Huntsville, Alabama. But to
do this he must cut off Chattanooga from all
railroad communication to the south and east,
and therefore all aid. In other words, we men
are to enter the enemy&#8217;s country in disguise,
capture a train on the Georgia State railroad,
steam off with it, and burn the bridges leading
in the direction of Chattanooga, on the northern
end of the road. It is one of the most daring
ideas ever conceived, and its execution will be
full of difficulties. If we fail we shall be hanged
as spies! If we succeed, there will be promotion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
and glory for all of us, and our names will go
down into history.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a murmur of encouragement from
the men, as one said: &#8220;We must succeed, if
only to save our necks.&#8221; The next moment the
barking of a dog could be heard above the
whistling of the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; cried Andrews, warningly;
&#8220;some one may be listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken before two figures
bounded from the encircling trees into the open
space wherein stood the startled conspirators.
While flashes of lightning played through the
branches, and gave fitful illumination to the
scene, the men saw revealed a lad of about fifteen
or sixteen years of age, flushed and breathless,
and at his heels a tiny Yorkshire terrier,
bright of face, and with an inquiring glance that
seemed to say: &#8220;What is all this fuss about?&#8221;
As the animal danced around the boy it was
evident that the latter was by no means frightened,
or even surprised, by the strangeness of
this meeting in the forest. His regular, handsome
features and intelligent, sparkling gray
eyes denoted excitement rather than fear. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
sprang forward, and, pulling a letter from an
inner pocket of his blue jacket, made straight
for Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if it isn&#8217;t George Knight,&#8221; muttered
one soldier, &#8220;and his chum, Waggie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog, hearing his own name, came up and
fawned upon the man who had spoken, while
the boy thrust into the hands of the leader the
letter which he had so carefully guarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is from General Mitchell,&#8221; explained
young Knight. &#8220;He said it was most urgent&mdash;and
I was to fetch it to you as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews opened the letter, as he replied
kindly to the lad: &#8220;You look out of breath,
George. Did you have a hard time reaching
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Waggie and I were hurrying up the
Shelbyville road in the darkness,&#8221; returned
George Knight, &#8220;we ran into a company of
Confederate guerrillas. They paid us the compliment
of firing at us&mdash;and we had to run for
our lives. But we gave the fellows the slip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Waggie gave a growl. Andrews,
who was about to read the letter from General
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
Mitchell, assumed a listening attitude. So did
every one else. Out on the highroad, not a hundred
yards away, could be heard the tramping
of horses. Involuntarily the men put their
hands towards the pockets which contained their
revolvers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guerrillas!&#8221; muttered the boy, as Andrews
gave him a questioning look.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many are there of them?&#8221; asked the
leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard to tell in the dark,&#8221; answered George.
&#8220;I think there were a dozen or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if that&#8217;s all, let&#8217;s give &#8217;em a scare, boys!&#8221;
laughed Andrews. Suiting the action to his
words, he pulled out a pistol from his hip pocket,
and fired it in the direction of the highroad.
His companions, nothing loath, quickly followed
his example. George and his canine
chum looked on expectantly, as if regretting
that neither of them possessed a weapon. Now
there came the clatter of hoofs, like a stampede,
and the guerrillas seemed to be engaged in a
wild scramble to get away. They were an intrepid
party, without doubt, but the sudden
volley from the mysterious and darkened recesses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
of the woods (which might come, for all
the Southerners knew, from a whole regiment of
troops) demoralized them. In another instant
they were scampering off, and the sound of the
horses on the road was soon lost in the distance.</p>
<p>Andrews replaced his revolver, with a little
chuckle of amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are a daring lot to venture so near our
army,&#8221; he said. Then he began to read the letter,
with the aid of a dark lantern provided by
one of his companions.</p>
<p>While he is engaged in this occupation let us
ask two questions. Who is Andrews, and who
is George Knight? James Andrews, though a
Virginian by birth, has lived in the mountains
of Kentucky for many years, and is now a spy
of the Union army, in the employ of General
Buell. The war is only fairly begun, but already
more than once has the spy courted death by
penetrating into the lines of the Confederacy, in
the guise of a merchant, and bringing back to
the Northern forces much valuable information.
He is a man of fine education and polished manners,
despite his life in the wilds, and is tall, aristocratic-looking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
and full of a quiet courage
which, in his own dangerous profession, answers
far better than the greatest impetuosity. He
has plenty of daring, but it is a daring tempered
with prudence. Although he has masqueraded
among the enemy at times when the slightest
slip of the tongue might have betrayed him, he
has thus far returned to the Union lines in
safety. How long, some of his friends ask anxiously,
will he be able to continue in so perilous
an enterprise? Yet here he is, planning, with
the consent of General Mitchell, a scheme bolder
than anything yet dreamed of in the annals of
the war.</p>
<p>And what of George Knight? He is an active,
healthy-minded drummer boy belonging to
one of the Ohio regiments in General Mitchell&#8217;s
division. His mother had died in his infancy.
At the outbreak of the war, a year before the
opening of our story, he was living in Cincinnati
with his father. The latter suddenly gave up a
prosperous law practice to go to the help of the
North, secured a commission as a captain of
volunteers, went to the front, and was either
captured or killed by the Confederates. Since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the preceding Christmas nothing had been heard
of him. George, with an aching heart, stayed at
home with an uncle, and chafed grievously as he
saw company after company of militia pass
through his native town on the way to the
South. Where was his father? This he asked
himself twenty times a day. And must he, the
son, stand idly by whilst thousands of the flower
of the land were rushing forward to fight on one
side or the other in the great conflict? &#8220;I must
enlist!&#8221; George had cried, more than once.
&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; replied his uncle; &#8220;you are too
young&mdash;a mere child.&#8221; But one fine day George
Knight had himself enrolled as a drummer boy
in a regiment then being recruited in Cincinnati,
and, as his uncle had a large family of his own,
with no very strong affection to spare for his
nephew, there was not as much objection as
might have been expected. So the lad went to
the war. He had now become a particular <i>protégé</i>
of General Mitchell, who had taken him into
his own service as an assistant secretary&mdash;a position
in which George had already shown much
natural cleverness.</p>
<p>After reading the letter just brought to him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Andrews tears it into a hundred little pieces
which he scatters to the winds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; ask several of the
men, as they crowd around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry&#8217;s the matter,&#8221; laughs the leader, as
unconcernedly as if he were speaking of nothing
more dangerous than a picnic. &#8220;The General
tells me we must start at once, if we want
to accomplish anything. To-morrow [Tuesday]
morning he takes his army straight south to
Huntsville. If he captures the town by Friday,
as he expects to do, he can move eastwards, to
Chattanooga. So we will do our bridge-burning
and our train-stealing on Friday, before the railroad
is obstructed with trains bringing Confederate
reinforcements to the latter city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even in the darkness one could detect the
gleam in the eyes of the men as they saw before
them, with pleasure rather than fear, the risky
part they were to play in the drama of warfare.
The eyes of George sparkled, likewise.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only go with them,&#8221; he thought.
What was camp life compared to the delight of
such an adventure? Waggie gave a bark. Even
he seemed to scent something interesting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You soldiers,&#8221; continued Andrews, &#8220;must
break into detachments, make your way eastward
into the Cumberland Mountains, and then
southward, well into the Confederate lines.
There you can take the cars, and by next Thursday
night you must all meet me down at Marietta,
Georgia. The next morning according to a
plan which you will learn at Marietta, (which is
on the Georgia State Railroad) we will put our
little ruse into effect&mdash;and may providence smile
on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will the men pretend to be while
on their way down to Marietta?&#8221; asked George,
who could scarce contain either his curiosity or
his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, my boy,&#8221; said Andrews, in a quick
though not in an unkindly way. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
that you should be hearing all this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had the scene been less dark one might have
seen the flush on the boy&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I was playing eavesdropper,&#8221;
he retorted.</p>
<p>Andrews put his right hand on George&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, in a spirit of friendliness;
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t exactly mean that. I know you&#8217;re to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
be trusted, from what General Mitchell has said
of you. But you must keep a tight rein on your
tongue, and not say a syllable, even in camp, of
this expedition. There&#8217;s no reason why the
whole army should be discussing it&mdash;until the
thing&#8217;s done. Then you can talk about it as
much as you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>George no longer felt offended. &#8220;You can
depend on me,&#8221; he said manfully. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
even tell the General.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this there was a peal of laughter from the
men, which seemed to be answered, the next instant,
by a blinding fork of lightning, and then
a fresh outburst of thunder. Andrews lifted up
his hand warningly. He was very grave, as befitted
a man on the verge of a mighty responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so loud,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;You boys must
impersonate Kentuckians who are trying to get
down south to join the Confederate army. A
great many fellows have gone from Kentucky to
throw in their lot with the Confederacy, and if
you are prudent you will have no trouble in
making people believe you. If any of you fall
under suspicion on the way, and are arrested, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
can enlist in the Confederate army, and then
escape from it at the first opportunity. The
Southerners are glad to get all the recruits they
can, suspicious or otherwise. But I hope you
will all reach Marietta in safety. Pray be careful
of one thing. If you meet me as we are
traveling, don&#8217;t recognize me unless you are sure
no one is watching us. At Marietta we will contrive
to meet in the hotel near the railroad station,
where I will tell you all that is to be done
the next morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no money for the journey,&#8221; interposed
a young volunteer. &#8220;Uncle Sam doesn&#8217;t
pay us privates very large salaries, you know,
Mr. Andrews.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews produced a large wallet from the inner
pocket of his overcoat. It was fairly bulging
with paper money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen to that,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a
whole wad of Confederate currency which will
pay your expenses through the Southern lines.&#8221;
And with that he began to deal out the bills to
the men, who hastily stowed away the money in
their own pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; went on the leader, &#8220;I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
you to divide yourselves into parties of three or
four, so that you may travel in separate groups,
and thus avoid the suspicion which might be
aroused if you all went in a body. And remember!
One party must have nothing to do with
another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon, in the gloomy woods, the future
spies formed themselves, as their inclinations directed,
into six parties or detachments, four containing
three men each, and two containing four.
Andrews was to proceed southward alone, without
an escort. Poor George Knight and Waggie
appeared to be left out in the cold. George was
burning to join the expedition. Even the rain
which suddenly began to fall could not quench
his ardor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Andrews,&#8221; he said, coming up close to
the leader, and speaking in a whisper, &#8220;can&#8217;t I
go to Marietta, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews peered at the boy in admiring surprise.
&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;you&#8217;re not
afraid of danger, even if you are little more than
a child. It&#8217;s bad enough for grown men to risk
their lives&mdash;and bad enough for me to drag them
into such a position,&mdash;without getting a plucky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
boy into the scrape also. No! Don&#8217;t ask me to
do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I won&#8217;t be in any more danger in the
South than I am here,&#8221; pleaded George. &#8220;If I
stay here I may be shot in battle, while if I go
to Marietta I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go to Marietta, and are found out,
you may be hanged as a spy,&#8221; interrupted Andrews.
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather see you shot than strung up
with a rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Confederates would never hang me if I
am little more than a child, as you call me,&#8221;
urged the lad.</p>
<p>Andrews was evidently impressed by George&#8217;s
persistence, but he hastened to say: &#8220;Anyway,
I have no authority to send you off on this chase.
You are a member of General Mitchell&#8217;s military
household, and he alone could give you the permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then promise me that if I get his permission
you will let me go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spy hesitated. He could just discern the
earnest, pleading expression in the upturned face
of the boy, upon which the rain-drops were pouring
almost unnoticed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;I am going back to
camp now, and I start out before daylight. If
you can induce the General to let you accompany
us before that time I&#8217;ll make no objection.&#8221;</p>
<p>George gave a little exclamation of delight.
&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, snapping his fingers at Waggie,
&#8220;let us see what we can do to talk the old General
into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rain was now coming down in torrents,
while the sharp, almost deafening cracks of thunder
sounded as if the whole artillery of the Union
army were engaged in practice. Soon all the
conspirators were hurrying back to camp. Andrews
was the very last to leave the woods where
he had divulged his plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven forgive me,&#8221; he mused, half sadly,
&#8220;if I am leading these boys into a death trap.&#8221;
But as a sudden flash of lightning illuminated the
wet landscape, as with the brightness of day, there
came into the leader&#8217;s strong face a look of calm
resolution. &#8220;It&#8217;s worth all the danger,&#8221; he
added.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>An hour later George Knight came running
into the tent which Andrews occupied in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
camp on Duck River. The leader was enveloped
in a woolen overcoat, and on his well-shaped
head was a slouch hat of the kind generally worn
by Southerners. By the dim, sickly light of the
candle which sputtered on a camp stool it could
be seen that he had been writing, for pen, ink
and a sealed letter were spread out upon the top
of a leathern army trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; cried Andrews, picking up the candle
from its tin socket and flashing it in the radiant
face of the boy. &#8220;Ah! No need to ask you! I
see by your dancing eyes that you have wheedled
old Mitchell into allowing you to do a foolish
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The smile on the lad&#8217;s face vanished. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you want me to go along with you?&#8221; he asked,
in an injured tone.</p>
<p>The leader replaced the candle in the socket
and then took one of George&#8217;s hands between his
own strong palms. &#8220;George,&#8221; he said cordially,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a boy after my own heart, and I&#8217;d like
nothing better than to have you for a companion;
but it&#8217;s because I do like you that I&#8217;m sorry you
are about to run such a risk&mdash;and that&#8217;s the truth.
How did you contrive to persuade the General?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>George seated himself on Andrews&#8217; bed, and
laughed. &#8220;It was hard work at first,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;but after he had refused me twice I
said to him: &#8216;General, if you were a boy in my
place, and had heard of this expedition, what
would you do?&#8217; &#8216;By all the stars,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I
would run away to it rather than miss it&mdash;and
get shot afterwards as a deserter, I suppose.&#8217;
&#8216;Then don&#8217;t put me under the temptation of running
away,&#8217; said I. At this the General laughed.
Then he said: &#8216;Well, tell Andrews you can go&mdash;and
that I&#8217;ll never forgive him if he lets anything
happen to you. After all, the Confederates
would never hang a child like you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he too calls you a child!&#8221; laughed Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m not a child,&#8221; cried George
proudly, as he jumped from the bed and stood up
very straight, to make himself look as tall as possible;
&#8220;but the General may call me a six-weeks&#8217;
old baby if he only lets me go along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no time to waste,&#8221; announced Andrews.
&#8220;In the third tent from mine, to the
right, you will find Privates Macgreggor and Watson,
of the Second Ohio Volunteers. They have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
just offered to go with us, and I have accepted
them in addition to the rest. Go to them, ask
them to get you a suit of plain clothes, put it on
instead of your uniform, and stick to them closely
from the moment you leave camp until you meet
me, as I hope you will, at Marietta. And be
particularly careful to have nothing about you
which could in any way lead to your identification
as a Union soldier in case you should be arrested
and searched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; said George, half under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;May we all be hurrahing this time next week,&#8221;
returned Andrews. &#8220;Here, George, as you go
out give this letter to the sentry outside, to be
sent off to-morrow in the camp mail.&#8221; As he
spoke he took the sealed note from the army
trunk, and handed it to the boy. &#8220;It is written
to the young woman I am engaged to marry,&#8221;
he explained, &#8220;and if we all get out of this bridge-burning
business with our heads on our shoulders
you can come dance at my wedding, and be my
best man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d dance at twenty weddings for you,&#8221; enthusiastically
cried George, who was beginning
to have a great admiration for his new friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me to be married twenty times,
do you, my boy?&#8221; protested Andrews, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would do a great deal to oblige you,&#8221; retorted
George. Then, after warmly grasping his
leader by the hand, he bounded out of the tent.
The night was black, and the rain was still descending
in a veritable torrent, but to the lad
everything seemed clear and rosy. He only saw
before him a mighty adventure&mdash;and that, to his
ardent, youthful spirit, made the whole world appear
charming.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>NEARING THE GOAL</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the Thursday afternoon succeeding the
Monday night described in the former chapter.
On the north bank of the Tennessee River, not
far from the town of Jasper, three drenched
figures might be discerned. They were looking
somewhat longingly in the direction of a white
frame house not fifty yards away from the
stream, which, swollen by the recent storms, was
in a particularly turbulent mood. There was
nothing very attractive about the building save
that it suggested shelter from the rain without,
and that the smoke curling up from its large
chimney held forth vague hopes of a palatable
supper. Certainly there was little in the landscape
itself to tempt any one to remain outdoors.
The three wanderers seemed to be of this
opinion, for they suddenly made a move towards
the house. They were roughly dressed, their
clothes were soaking, and their high boots bore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
the evidence of a long, muddy tramp across
country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; grumbled one of them, a thick-set,
middle-aged man, with a good-humored expression
and a four-days&#8217; growth of iron-gray beard
on his face; &#8220;why did I leave home and home
cooking to enlist in the army and then wander
over the earth like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Watson!&#8221; exclaimed the person next to
him, in a tone of boyish surprise; &#8220;how can you
talk like that? Why, <i>I</i> am having the time of
my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker was George Knight. There was
mud on his face, and the natty drummer boy in
blue uniform had given place to a young fellow
who outwardly resembled an ordinary farm hand.
But there could be no doubt, from the light
which shone in his bright eyes, that he was enjoying
himself to the full.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; returned Watson. &#8220;When you
get as old as I am, my boy, you won&#8217;t take such
keen delight in walking through mire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy laughed, and turned to the third
member of the party. &#8220;Are you tired, too, Macgreggor?&#8221;
he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>Macgreggor, a compactly built, athletic young
man of twenty-seven or thereabouts, with a
light-brown beard and mustache which made
him look older than he really was, shook the rain
from his hat and said cheerily, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done a good
deal of mountain climbing since Tuesday morning,
but I&#8217;m not too tired to eat a good supper,
if we are lucky enough to find one in this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>It need hardly be repeated that Watson and
Macgreggor were the two men in whose care
Andrews had placed George Knight. They
were both brave, resourceful men. During their
long trudge across the mountainous country
between Shelbyville and the Tennessee, Watson
had uttered many a grumble, but his complaints
meant nothing more than a desire to
hear himself talk. When it came to fording a
stream, climbing a precipice, or fairly wading
through the slush, he was quite as willing and
energetic as the other two members of his
party.</p>
<p>George knocked loudly at the door of the
house, as he and his companions hastily sheltered
themselves under the little piazza which ran along
the front of the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Be on your guard, boys,&#8221; whispered Watson.
&#8220;Stick to your story about our being Kentuckians,
and say nothing imprudent that may arouse
suspicion. Remember! we <i>must</i> be in Marietta
by to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting at Marietta had, at the very last
moment, been postponed by Andrews from
Thursday night to Friday night. &#8220;It is well he
did postpone it,&#8221; thought Macgreggor; &#8220;we are
far enough from Marietta as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door was suddenly thrown open by an
old negro &#8220;aunty&#8221; behind whom stood a neat,
bustling little white woman. The latter was evidently
engaged in the business of preparing supper,
if one might judge from the fact that her bare
arms were almost encaked in flour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are three Kentuckians from Fleming
County on our way to enlist in Chattanooga,&#8221;
spoke out Macgreggor, in a voice which seemed
to have the ring of truth in it. &#8220;Can we spend
the night here, so that we can cross the river in
the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>The expression of the woman, which had at
first been one of surprise and irritation at being
stopped in her work, softened immediately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
&#8220;Come in,&#8221; she said, quickly; &#8220;my husband&#8217;s
only a farmer, and we can&#8217;t give you anything
very fine, but it was never said of Mandy Hare
that she turned away from her house any loyal
friend of the South.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she led her gratified visitors through
a scantily-furnished parlor into a kitchen which
seemed to them like a Paradise. Over the roaring
fire in the great hearth several vessels were
simmering and emitting the most delightful
odors, while a table near by was already set for
the coming meal. On a chair facing the fire a
fat, white cat was purring blissfully. The room
was delightfully warm; the whole scene had an
irresistible attraction and air of domesticity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make yourselves at home,&#8221; commanded Mrs.
Hare, cheerfully. &#8220;My husband will be home
from Jasper in a few minutes, and then you&#8217;ll
have something to eat&mdash;such as &#8217;tis.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this instant there was a querulous little
bark, which appeared to come from the region
of George Knight&#8217;s heart. Mrs. Hare looked
around in surprise; the white cat stirred uneasily.
The next second the boy had shaken his
overcoat, and from out of a large side pocket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
jumped the diminutive Waggie. The cat, with
one bound, took a flying leap to the kitchen
stairs, and brushing past the half-opened door at
the bottom of the flight, fairly tore up to the
second story, where she disappeared. Waggie
gave a shrill yelp of emotion, but evidently concluded
that it was safer not to chase a strange
and muscular cat in a strange house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious me,&#8221; cried Mrs. Hare; &#8220;did you
bring that little fellow all the way from Kentucky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came away he followed me,&#8221; replied
George. He spoke the truth, although he did
not add that he &#8220;came away&#8221; from a Union
camp rather than from Kentucky. Waggie had
been consigned to a member of General Mitchell&#8217;s
staff, to remain with him during his owner&#8217;s
absence, but George had not proceeded five miles
on his journey before he heard a joyous bark behind
him&mdash;and there frisked and capered Waggie.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to turn spy now,&#8221; George
said. It was too late to send him back. Thus
the dog joined the party, much to the pleasure
of all concerned.</p>
<p>Hardly had Waggie made his theatrical entrance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
into the kitchen before a lean, prematurely
shriveled man of fifty, whose long shaggy beard
proclaimed him a veritable countryman, came
shambling into the room. At sight of the three
strangers a curious look came into his restless
eyes. It was almost as if the look was one of
triumph. George, observing it, shivered, although
he could hardly say why he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my husband,&#8221; explained Mrs. Hare,
with an awkward attempt at courtesy. &#8220;These
men,&#8221; she continued, addressing her lord and
master, &#8220;have the good of the Southern cause at
heart, and are on their way to Chattanooga, to
enlist in the Confederate army.&#8221; She cast such
an approving glance upon the wanderers as she
spoke, and was so good-natured, that George&#8217;s
heart smote him at the deception which was
being practised upon her. He was a frank,
honest boy, who hated the very idea of appearing
anywhere under false pretences. But he
realized that he was playing a part for the good
of his General, and his General&#8217;s cause, and he
resolved to maintain, as well as he could, his new
character of a Southern sympathizer.</p>
<p>Farmer Hare gave to each of the visitors a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
surly recognition. Waggie walked up to him,
sniffed about his boots, and uttered a low growl.
It was plain that the dog did not approve of the
master of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows are taking a pretty long journey
to serve the South,&#8221; remarked Mr. Hare at last,
in a nasal tone sadly at variance with the customary
soft Southern cadence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can he suspect us?&#8221; thought Watson. The
same thought went through the mind of Macgreggor,
but he merely said: &#8220;We are nearly
at our journey&#8217;s end now. By to-morrow we
will be in Chattanooga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down and make yourselves comfortable,&#8221;
snarled Hare, with the air of an unwilling host.
The visitors took the chairs which Mrs. Hare
had placed for them at the supper-table. They
were joined by husband and wife, and the negro
&#8220;aunty&#8221; was soon serving a delicious meal of
corn bread, Irish stew, and other good things.
They all ate with a will, including Waggie,
who was given a private lot of bones by the
fireside. When the supper was over the farmer
arose abruptly. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose you fellows have had
a pretty long tramp, and want to go to bed,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
said. &#8220;We keep good hours in this house, anyway,
and turn in early at night&mdash;so that we may
turn out early in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them a chance to dry themselves before
the fire,&#8221; urged Mrs. Hare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em dry themselves in bed,&#8221; muttered
the farmer. Whereupon he lighted a candle,
and turned towards the door leading to the second
story. He was evidently in a great hurry
to get his guests up-stairs. Watson, Macgreggor
and George looked at one another, as if trying
to fathom the cause of their peculiar reception at
the hands of Farmer Hare. But each one silently
decided that their only cue was to be as
polite as possible, and refrain from any altercation
with their host.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; thought Watson, &#8220;if we can
spend the night here we will be off again at
dawn&mdash;and then let our surly host take himself
to Kamchatka, for all we care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Watson and Macgreggor,
thoroughly tired out, were sound asleep, in one
of the small rooms in the second-story of the
house. George, however, lay tossing from side
to side on a bed in the adjoining room, directly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
over the kitchen, with Waggie curled up on the
floor close by. The more he thought of the
strange behavior of Hare the more uneasy he
became. Why had the farmer regarded him
and his two companions with such a suspicious
glance? Then George suddenly recollected
where he had seen that face before. Yes!
There could be no mistake. While he, Macgreggor
and Watson were dining that day at
the village tavern in Jasper, Hare was loitering
on the porch of the place. But what of that?
The three pretended Kentuckians had told their
usual story, and professed their love for the
Confederacy, and no one there had seemed to
doubt their truthfulness for a moment.</p>
<p>In vain the boy tried to fall asleep. At last,
hearing voices in the kitchen, he rose quietly
from his bed, stole out of his room, and stealthily
walked to the little hallway that led to the
kitchen stairway. At the head of the staircase
he halted. It was clear that Farmer Hare was
saying something emphatic, while his wife was
entering a feeble protest. An intuition told the
listener that his own party was the subject of
discussion. Slowly, cautiously, he crept down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the stairway, until he almost touched the closed
door which led from it to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, woman,&#8221; Hare was saying, &#8220;these
three fellows are spies of some sort, and the
sooner we have them under arrest the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; murmured the wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care whether you believe it or not,&#8221;
rejoined the husband, in a harsh tone. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
I tell you that when these two men, and the
boy, were at the tavern in Jasper to-day, one of
the men was recognized by John Henderson.
Henderson is a spy in the service of General
Beauregard, and was in the camp of General
Mitchell only a few days ago, disguised as a
trader. There he saw this fellow&mdash;the one with
the brown beard&mdash;and he swears there&#8217;s no
mistake. But he didn&#8217;t tell us in time&mdash;the
three disappeared. No; there&#8217;s mischief of
some sort brewing here, and I intend to stop it,
if my name&#8217;s Hare. We don&#8217;t want any spies
around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spies!&#8221; exclaimed the woman. &#8220;Then if
they are caught within our lines they will be
shot!&#8221; It seemed as if she shuddered as she
spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Or hanged,&#8221; added the farmer, with an unpleasant
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them go,&#8221; whispered Mrs. Hare, pleadingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just as good a Confederate as you
are, Jake, but don&#8217;t let us have the blood of
these fellows on our hands. That nice little
chap with the dog&mdash;I would as soon see my own
son get into trouble, if I was lucky enough to
have one, as that bright-eyed boy. Turn &#8217;em
out of the house, Jake, if you suspect them&mdash;tell
them to go about their business&mdash;but don&#8217;t set a
trap for them.&#8221; Her voice became almost plaintive.
It was evident that the strangers had
made a favorable impression upon Mrs. Hare,
and that her woman&#8217;s feelings revolted at the
idea of betraying them, even though they were
the secret enemies of her cause. &#8220;I hate war,
anyway,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It sets friend against
friend, brother against brother, father against
son, state against state. All this trouble between
the North and South might have been
fixed up without fighting, if there&#8217;d been a little
more patience on both sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t preach,&#8221; muttered Hare. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t
time for it. Where&#8217;s Uncle Daniel?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>The listening George did not know that
&#8220;Uncle Daniel&#8221; was the black farm-hand who
helped Hare, but, from the name, he felt sure
that a slave was meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Daniel is out in the barn, I reckon,&#8221;
answered the wife. &#8220;What do you want him
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; rejoined her husband, gruffly.
With that enigmatical reply he opened a door
leading to the barn, stalked out, and disappeared.
There was a half-stifled cry from Mrs.
Hare, but she apparently made no effort to
detain him. &#8220;The Vigilants! Oh! the Vigilants!&#8221;
she repeated, in accents of distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner we get out of this the better for
our necks,&#8221; thought George. He had no sense
of fear; he was only filled with one consuming
idea. He must get word to his two companions,
and at once. Just what Hare contemplated in
the way of a trap he could not tell, yet it was
evident that the sooner Watson and Macgreggor
were awakened the more chance would all three
have for escaping from whatever fate the farmer
had in store for them.</p>
<p>Cautiously George crept back until he was at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the door of the room where the two men were
heavily sleeping. His first impulse was to rattle
at the knob; but he recollected in time that this
would make a noise that might bring Mrs. Hare
to the scene. He stood still and reflected. It
would be foolish to invite the attention of her
husband or herself before a plan of action could
be decided upon. For nearly five minutes he
stood in the hallway, wondering how he could
awaken his tired fellows without making a disturbance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I&#8217;m very stupid,&#8221; thought the
boy. He could hear the kitchen door open, as
Hare came back into the house, and began talking
to his wife in low tones. He could distinguish
but one word. It was &#8220;Vigilants!&#8221;</p>
<p>At last he gave a faint exclamation of satisfaction,
and stole back to his own room. Waggie,
who was now lying on the bed, moved
uneasily. George lighted a candle and examined
the plastered wall which ran between his room
and the one where the unconscious Watson and
Macgreggor were gently snoring. He knew that
the bed on which they slept was directly on the
other side of this wall, and he judged that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
partition itself was very thin. In this theory he
was correct: the laths and their plaster covering
formed a mere shell, which was not much
thicker than an ordinary wooden partition.
Taking a large jack knife from his waistcoat he
began to cut into the wall, about four feet from
the floor. Before long he had made a small hole,
not bigger than the dimensions of a five-dollar
gold piece, straight through the plaster. Looking
through it, with the aid of his candle, he
saw that Watson and Macgreggor were stretched
out in bed on the other side, each half-dressed
and each sleeping as if there were no such thing
in the world as war or danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserve a good sleep,&#8221; said the boy to
himself; &#8220;but it can&#8217;t be helped, so here goes!&#8221;
At the same moment he extinguished his candle,
pulled it out of the candlestick, and poked it
through the hole. He directed it in such a
way that it fell squarely on the face of Macgreggor.
The man suddenly stopped snoring,
turned his body from one side to the other, and
then started up in the bed, in a half-sitting posture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Macgreggor! Mac!&#8221; whispered George;
&#8220;it&#8217;s I, George Knight. Don&#8217;t speak loud.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where on earth are you?&#8221; asked the newly-awakened
sleeper, in a startled voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind where I am,&#8221; answered George.
&#8220;Only don&#8217;t make a noise. But get up, light
your candle, and open your door for me without
letting them hear you down-stairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time Watson was awake too, and had
jumped to the floor. When Macgreggor lighted
his candle, and saw the little hole in the wall, at
which appeared one of George&#8217;s eyes, he almost
gave a cry of surprise; but prudence restrained
him, and he merely touched Watson&#8217;s
arm, pointed to the hole, and then quietly unlocked
the door of their room. George soon
crept carefully in, and proceeded, in as low a
voice as he could command, to tell the two men
what he had heard from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Vigilants!&#8221; whispered Watson. &#8220;Why,
don&#8217;t you know what that means? When we
were in Jasper to-day I saw some of them standing
around the village grocery store, and even
talked with them. They thought I was a good
&#8216;Confed,&#8217; and I found out that they are organized
into a band to arrest suspicious characters,
keep things in order in this section of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
county and even turn guerrillas when they are
wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the whole thing,&#8221; said Macgreggor.
&#8220;This Hare has sent his negro over to Jasper to
bring the Vigilants here to take charge of us,
and to string us up, no doubt, to the first convenient
tree. The sooner we get away from here
the better for our lives. Jasper is only two
miles off, and the Vigilants will be riding over
here before we have time to say Jack Robinson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still time,&#8221; said George, &#8220;and as
there&#8217;s only one man here against us now&mdash;I
mean Hare&mdash;we can seize him, tie him to something,
and then escape into the darkness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we can, my boy,&#8221; replied Watson, who
was thinking as deeply and as calmly as if a
game of chess, rather than a matter of life and
death, were the issue. &#8220;There&#8217;s no trouble as to
our escaping. But remember this. It&#8217;s pitch
dark and raining again like cats and dogs; we
don&#8217;t know our way; we are sure to get lost before
we have run fifty yards from the house, and
these Vigilants, who understand every foot of
the country, will divide into small parties, and
hunt us down, as sure as fate. And if they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
can&#8217;t, they will put hounds on our track&mdash;and
then we&#8217;ll be beautifully carved up into beefsteaks.
I have seen hounds, and I know how
they appreciate a nice little man hunt.&#8221; Watson
smiled grimly.</p>
<p>Macgreggor walked silently to one of the windows,
opened the sash just a crack, and listened.
He could hear nothing but the downpour of the
rain. Yet it would not be long before the Vigilants
dashed up to the house. No doubt they
had all been telling anecdotes in the corner grocery
store, and they would take but a short time
for the mounting of their horses. Cautiously
closing the window he returned to the centre of
the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dark night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and all the better
for a plan I have to propose. We are each
secretly armed with pistols, are we not? Well,
then, let us put out this candle, and open the
window to the left, looking out towards the highroad
to Jasper. When the Vigilants come riding
up the road and get in front of the house we will
suddenly fire on them. This may cause a panic,
as the fellows will not be able to tell just where
the enemy are, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; interrupted Watson. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
know whom you&#8217;re dealing with. These Vigilants
are as brave as they are reckless, and there
are at least twenty-five or thirty of them. Three
men can&#8217;t frighten them. They would only get
us in the end, even if we did succeed in disabling
one or two of them in the first surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what are we to do?&#8221; asked George
eagerly. Watson was so composed that the boy
felt sure he must have some better plan for escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a scheme,&#8221; said Watson, quite simply.
&#8220;I have been hatching it in my brain while we
were talking. But the quicker it&#8217;s put to the
test, the quicker will we save our necks. Are
you willing to trust me blindly?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a whispered &#8220;yes&#8221; from both the
other conspirators. Watson inspired confidence
by his assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us get all our clothes, shoes, everything
on at once, and walk boldly down-stairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three minutes later the trio were marching
down-stairs into the kitchen. Hare and his wife
were standing at the fireplace, looking the picture
of surprise, as their guests burst into the room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
with the irrepressible Waggie at their heels. The
old negro &#8220;aunty,&#8221; who had been dozing on a
stool near the hearth, jumped to her rheumatic
feet in consternation. &#8220;Hallelujah! Hallelujah!&#8221;
she cried, throwing her withered arms above her
turbaned head. For the guests held revolvers in
their hands, and the &#8220;aunty&#8217;s&#8221; heart always sank
at the thought of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The farmer took a step forward, as if uncertain
what to do or say. At last he said, trying to
smile, yet only succeeding in looking hypocritical:
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t going to leave us this time of night,
are you? Wait till morning, and get some
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice breakfast you&#8217;d give us in the
morning,&#8221; laughed Watson, with a significant
look at their host. &#8220;A halter stew, or some roast
bullets, I guess!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hare jumped backward with such suddenness
that he almost knocked into the fire his frightened
wife who had been standing directly behind
him. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he hissed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know perfectly well what I mean, Mr.
Hare,&#8221; said Watson, looking him straight in the
face, whilst the other spectators listened in breathless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
interest. &#8220;You have sent word to the Jasper
Vigilants to ride over here and arrest us, on
the suspicion of being spies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had the heavens suddenly fallen, the countenances
of the Hares could not have shown more
dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you find that out?&#8221; asked the
farmer, quite forgetting to play his part of amiable
host.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind how,&#8221; cried George, who was
burning to play his part. &#8220;Only it&#8217;s a pity you
haven&#8217;t as much mercy in you as your wife
has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Watson, as he motioned the
others in the room to be silent. &#8220;George, you
will watch this old negress, and if she attempts
to make a sound, or to leave the room before we
are ready, give her a hint from your revolver.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a scream of fright, comical in its intensity,
the &#8220;aunty&#8221; sank back on her stool near the
hearth, and covered her dark face with her hands.
There she sat, as if she expected to be murdered
at any moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Macgreggor,&#8221; continued Watson
impressively, &#8220;will keep the same sort of watch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
over Mrs. Hare. Happen what may, there is not
to be a sound from either woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hare started in confusion. Her husband
made a bound for the kitchen door. With another
bound no less quick Watson darted forward,
caught the farmer, pushed him back at the point
of the pistol, and bolted the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; demanded Hare.
&#8220;Are we to be murdered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; cried Watson, &#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there came the sound of horses&#8217; hoofs in
the distance. Every one listened eagerly, and
none more so than the farmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re done for,&#8221; he said slowly, casting a
half-malevolent, half-triumphant glance at the
three Northerners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by a great deal,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;March
with me to the parlor, open the front door just a
crack, and, when the Vigilants come up, say to
them that we three men have escaped from the
house, stolen a flatboat, and started to row across
the Tennessee River. Send them away and shut
the door. I will be standing near you, behind
the door, with my pistol leveled at your head.
Make one movement to escape, or say anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
but what I have told you to say, and you are a
dead man!&#8221;</p>
<p>The patter of the horses was becoming more
and more distinct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you do as I tell you?&#8221; asked Watson,
very coolly, as he toyed with his revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I won&#8217;t?&#8221; asked Hare. His face was
now convulsed by a variety of emotions&mdash;fear,
rage, craftiness, and disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you three seconds to choose,&#8221; said
Watson. &#8220;If you refuse, you will be stretched
out on that floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hare, with white cheeks, leaned forward,
and whispered to her husband: &#8220;Do as he tells
you, Jake. Better let these Yankees go, and save
your own life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; counted Watson.</p>
<p>Hare held up his right hand, and then dropped
it listlessly by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give in,&#8221; he said sullenly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
the better of me.&#8221; He looked, for all the world,
like a whipped cur.</p>
<p>There was not a second to lose. The horsemen
were riding up to the house. Watson motioned
to the farmer, who walked into the parlor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
which was unlighted, closely followed by the
soldier. There were sounds without, as of horses
being reined in, and of men&#8217;s gruff voices. Hare
opened the parlor door a few inches, while Watson,
safe from observation, stationed himself
within a few feet of him, with cocked revolver.
&#8220;Remember!&#8221; he whispered, significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, boys?&#8221; shouted Hare. &#8220;Those
three spies I sent word about escaped from here
ten minutes ago, stole a boat on the bank, down
by the landing, and started to row across the
river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will never reach the other side a night
like this,&#8221; called out some one.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you let &#8217;em get away from you
for?&#8221; asked another of the Vigilants.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I help it?&#8221; growled the farmer.
&#8220;They were well armed&mdash;and &#8217;twas three men
against one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah! You&#8217;ve brought us out on a wild-goose
chase, and on a durned bad night,&#8221; came a voice
from the wet and darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;ll drift back to this side of the
river, and can be caught,&#8221; one Vigilant suggested.
But this idea evidently met with little approval.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
It was plain, from what Watson could hear of
the discussion which ensued, that the Vigilants
were disgusted. They were ready, indeed, to
give up the chase, on the supposition that the
three fugitives would either drift down in midstream,
or else be capsized and find a watery
grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, we&#8217;ll get home again,&#8221; commanded a
horseman, who appeared to be the leader. &#8220;And
no thanks to you, Jake Hare, for making us
waste our time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say Jake, won&#8217;t you ask us in to have something
warm to drink?&#8221; cried another Vigilant.</p>
<p>Watson edged a trifle nearer to Hare, and
whispered: &#8220;Send &#8217;em away at once, or
else&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Once bring the Vigilants into the house, as the
soldier knew, and capture or death would be the
result.</p>
<p>Hare could almost feel the cold muzzle of the
revolver near his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, fellows,&#8221; he called, &#8220;You know
I ain&#8217;t got nothing for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A jeer, and a few sarcastic groans greeted this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
remark. &#8220;I always reckoned you was a skinflint,&#8221;
yelled one of the party.</p>
<p>There was a derisive cheer at this sally. Then,
at a word of command, the Vigilants turned
their horses and cantered back towards Jasper.
The sound of hoofs became fainter and
fainter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut the door,&#8221; ordered Watson, &#8220;and go
back to the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sullenly the farmer obeyed. When the two
were once more by the blazing hearth, George
and Macgreggor, who had been guarding Mrs.
Hare and the negress, rushed forward to grasp
the hands of their deliverer. They were about
to congratulate him upon his successful nerve
and diplomacy when he interrupted them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about that,&#8221; he said; &#8220;let us
get away from here as soon as possible, before
our kind host has a chance to play us any more
tricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you think yourself pretty smart,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; snapped Hare, casting a spiteful
glance at Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;So smart,&#8221; put in George, &#8220;that if you don&#8217;t
want to be laughed at from now until the day of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
your death you&#8217;d better not tell the citizens of
Jasper about to-night&#8217;s occurrences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, boys, let us be going,&#8221; exclaimed
Watson impatiently, as he offered his hand to
Mrs. Hare, and said to that lady: &#8220;Thank you
for the best supper we&#8217;ve had since we left&mdash;home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hare refused to shake hands, but she regarded
Watson with an admiring expression.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t shake hands with you,&#8221; she replied,
half smiling, &#8220;for you may be an enemy of the
South, but I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve escaped hanging.
You&#8217;ve too much grit for that. As for you,
Jake, don&#8217;t ever pretend to us again that you&#8217;re
the brainiest man in the county.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue, woman,&#8221; cried the amiable
farmer.</p>
<p>In a couple of minutes the three travelers were
striking out from the back of the house into the
slush, and rain, and blackness of the night.
Waggie was occupying his usual place inside a
pocket of George&#8217;s overcoat. He had supped
regally at the Hares on bacon and bones, and he
felt warm and at peace with the world.</p>
<p>Before the party had more than emerged from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the garden (a task by no means easy in itself, on
account of the darkness), something whistled by
them, to the accompaniment of a sharp report.
Looking behind them they saw the meagre form
of Hare standing in the kitchen doorway. He
held a rifle in his right hand. The kitchen fire
made him plainly visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good aim, old boy,&#8221; shouted Macgreggor,
&#8220;considering you could hardly see us.
But I can see you plainly enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke he drew his revolver. Hare was
already putting the rifle to his shoulder, preparing
for another shot. He had hardly had a
chance to adjust the gun, however, before he
dropped it with a cry of pain and ran into the
house. A bullet had come whizzing from Macgreggor,
and struck the farmer in his right arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little souvenir to remember me by,&#8221;
laughed the lucky marksman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; cried Watson. &#8220;To-morrow
night we must be in Marietta. We are still
many miles away, and in a hostile, unknown
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the three pushed on into the gloom. The
prospect of meeting James Andrews at the appointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
place was not reassuring. Their only
hope was to keep on along the bank of the Tennessee
River until they reached Chattanooga.
From there they could take a train for Marietta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we make it?&#8221; thought George. Waggie
gave a muffled bark which seemed to say:
&#8220;Courage!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>MINGLING WITH THE ENEMY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was weary work, this tramping along the
Tennessee shore, through mud, or fields of stubble,
over rocks, or amid dripping trees; but the
three kept on towards Chattanooga for a couple
of hours, until all the good effects of their warming
at Farmer Hare&#8217;s were quite vanished. Watson,
having showed by his mother-wit and presence
of mind that he was a man to be relied
upon, had now resumed his privilege of growling,
and gave vent to many angry words at the
roughness and unutterable dreariness of the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why was America ever discovered by that
inquisitive, prying old Christopher Columbus?&#8221;
he grunted, after he had tripped over the stump
of a cottonwood-tree, and fallen flat with his
face in the slime. &#8220;If he had never discovered
America there would never have been any
United States; had there never been any United
States there would never have been any war between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
North and South; had there never been
any war between North and South I wouldn&#8217;t
be making a fool of myself by being down here.
I wish that fellow Columbus had never been
born&mdash;or, if he was born, that he had never been
allowed to sail off for America. Ugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes they reached a log cabin
situated on an angle of land where a little stream
emptied itself into the now stormy waters of the
Tennessee River. There was no light nor sign
of life about the mean abode, and the travelers
were almost upon it before they saw its low outline
in the dense gloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Watson, calling a halt.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no use in our trying to go further to-night.
It&#8217;s too dark to make any sort of time.
And we are far enough away now from Jasper
to avoid any danger of pursuit&mdash;even if our
amiable friend Mr. Hare should inform the
Vigilants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of that,&#8221; said Macgreggor
and George in the same breath. Hare was not
likely to relate a joke so much at his own expense
as their clever escape had proved. Even
if he did, they reasoned, the chances of capture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
were now rather slim, whatever they might have
been when the three fugitives were nearer Jasper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us get a few hours&#8217; sleep in this
cabin,&#8221; urged Watson. &#8220;Some negro probably
lives here&mdash;and we can tell him our usual Kentucky
story. Give the door a pound, George,
and wake him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>George used first his hands and then his boots
on the door, in a vain effort to make some one
hear. He took Waggie out of his pocket, and
the shrill little barks of the dog added to the
noise as he jumped around his master&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s break the door down,&#8221; urged Macgreggor.
&#8220;The seven sleepers must live here.
We might pound all night and not get in.&#8221;</p>
<p>With one accord the three threw themselves
vigorously against the door. They expected to
meet with some resistance, due to a bolt or two;
but, instead of that, the door flew open so suddenly
that they were precipitated into the cabin,
and lay sprawling on the ground. It had been
latched but neither locked nor bolted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were too smart that time,&#8221; growled
Watson, as the three picked themselves up, to
the great excitement of Waggie. &#8220;The place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
must be deserted. So much the better for us.
We can get a little sleep without having to go
into explanations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew from inside his greatcoat, with much
care, three or four matches. By lighting, first
one and then the others, he was able to grope
around until he found the hearth of the cabin.
Cold ashes marked the remains of a fire long
since extinguished. His foot struck against
something which proved to be a small piece of
dry pine-wood. With the flame from his last
match Watson succeeded in lighting this remnant
of kindling. He carefully nursed the new
flame until the stick blazed forth like a torch.
Then the travelers had a chance to examine the
one room which formed the whole interior of the
lonely place. The cabin was deserted. It contained
not a bit of furniture; nothing, indeed,
save bare walls of logs, and rude mortar, and a
clean pine floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;This palace can&#8217;t be renting at a very high
price,&#8221; remarked Macgreggor, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will do us well enough for a few hours&#8217;
sleep,&#8221; said George.</p>
<p>Watson nodded his head in assent. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
shelter from the rain, at least,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
that&#8217;s something on such a pesky night.&#8221; While
he was speaking the rush of the rain without
confirmed the truth of his words, and suggested
that any roof was better than none. Ere long
the pine stick burned itself out; the intruders
were left in absolute darkness. But they quickly
disposed themselves on the floor, where, worn
out by the fatigues of the day and the stirring
adventure of the evening, they were soon fast
asleep. They had closed the door, near which
Waggie had settled his little body in the capacity
of a sentinel. George dreamed of his
father. He saw him standing at the window of
a prison, as he stretched his hands through the
bars and cried out: &#8220;George, I am here&mdash;here!
Help me!&#8221; Then the boy&#8217;s dream changed. He
was back in the dark woods near Shelbyville,
listening to Andrews as the leader outlined the
expedition in which they were now engaged. In
the middle of the conference some one cried:
&#8220;The Confederates are on us!&#8221; George tried to
run, but something pinned him to the ground&mdash;a
wild animal was at his throat.</p>
<p>He awoke with a start, to find that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Waggie was leaping upon his chest, barking
furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush up, you little rascal!&#8221; ordered George.
He felt very sleepy, and he was angry at being
aroused. But Waggie went on barking until he
had succeeded in awakening Macgreggor and
Watson, and convincing his master that something
was wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; demanded Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said George, softly. He was on his
feet in an instant, as he ran first to one and then
to the other of the two windows which graced
the cabin. These windows, however, were barricaded
with shutters. He hurried to the door,
which he opened a few inches. The rain had
now stopped, and he could hear, perhaps a quarter
of a mile away, the sound of horses moving
cautiously through the mud, along the river
bank. In a twinkling Watson and Macgreggor
were at his side, straining their ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be cavalry?&#8221; asked Macgreggor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mounted men at least,&#8221; whispered Watson.
&#8220;Perhaps the Vigilants are on our track, bad
luck to them!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can Hare have told them, after all?&#8221; queried
George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; muttered Watson,
&#8220;but I think we have the gentlemen from Jasper
to deal with once again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s decamp into the darkness before it&#8217;s
too late,&#8221; said Macgreggor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; whispered Watson impatiently.
&#8220;If they are on the scent, and we leave this hut,
they will only run us to earth like hounds after
a fox.&#8221;</p>
<p>The baying of dogs which were evidently accompanying
the party gave a sudden and terrible
effect to the force of Watson&#8217;s argument. And
now the Vigilants, if such they were, came nearer
and nearer. The three Northerners who listened
so anxiously at the doorway could already detect
the sound of voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s but one thing for us to do,&#8221; quickly
murmured Watson. &#8220;We must stay in this
cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they won&#8217;t pass the place by,&#8221; urged
Macgreggor. &#8220;If they know it to be deserted
by a tenant this is the very reason for their
looking in to see if we are hiding here. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
when it comes to defending ourselves, how can
we put up any sort of barricade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you can&#8217;t use force, or hide yourself,
try a little strategy,&#8221; answered the soldier.
&#8220;Can either of you fellows talk like a darky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; said Macgreggor. Had he been
asked if he could speak Hebrew, he would not
have been more surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you, George?&#8221; asked Watson, as he
shut the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; whispered George. &#8220;When I was
up in Cincinnati we boys used&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what you boys did&mdash;only do as I
tell you, and if you can give a good imitation
you may save us from arrest, and worse!&#8221;</p>
<p>The horsemen now seemed to be within a few
yards of the cabin. They had evidently halted
for consultation. Meanwhile Watson was whispering
some instructions to George. After he
had finished he leaned against the door with his
whole weight, and indicated to Macgreggor that
he was to do the same thing. The latter
obeyed in silence.</p>
<p>The horsemen without made a great deal of
clatter. If they were pursuing the fugitives they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
did not seem to think secrecy of movement very
necessary. &#8220;Whose cabin is this?&#8221; demanded
one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It did belong to old Sam Curtis, but he&#8217;s
moved away, down to Alabama,&#8221; some one
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some darky may live in it now, eh?&#8221; said
the first voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s empty, and these tarnation
spies are in it,&#8221; was the rejoinder in a lower
tone.</p>
<p>The men moved their horses closer to the
house, which they quickly surrounded. No
chance now for any one to escape; it seemed as
if the three men in the cabin must inevitably be
caught like rats in a trap. Yet they waited courageously,
breathlessly. It was a tense moment.
Another minute would decide their fate. Would
they remain free men, or would they fall into the
hands of their pursuers, with all the consequences
that such a capture implied?</p>
<p>Already one of the Vigilants, evidently the
leader, had dismounted. Approaching the door
of the cabin, he gave it a push as if he expected
it would open at once. But there was no yielding;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Watson and Macgreggor were still leaning
firmly against the other side.</p>
<p>The leader began to knock on the door with a
revolver. &#8220;Here, here,&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;if there&#8217;s
any one in this cabin, come out&mdash;or we&#8217;ll have
you out!&#8221;</p>
<p>At first there was no response, save a bark
from Waggie. The leader rattled savagely at
the door. &#8220;Let&#8217;s break in,&#8221; he cried to his companions,
&#8220;and see if the place has any one in
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Vigilants were about to follow the example
of their leader, and dismount when there
came a wheedling voice&mdash;apparently the voice of
a negress&mdash;from within the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you gemmen want dis time o&#8217; night
wid poor Aunty Dinah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nigger&#8217;s living here,&#8221; muttered the leader,
in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for you gwyne to disturb an ole niggah
at dis hour?&#8221; asked the voice from within.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, aunty,&#8221; called out the leader.
&#8220;We only want some information. Come to the
door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In one minute I be with you,&#8221; was the answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;se a nursin&#8217; my old man here&mdash;he
done gone and took the smallpox&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The smallpox! Had the voice announced that
a million Union troops were descending upon the
party the consternation would not have been
half as great. The smallpox! At the mention
of that dreaded name, and at the thought that
they were so close to contagion, the Vigilants,
with one accord, put spurs into their horses and
rushed madly away. The leader, dropping his
revolver in his excitement, and not even stopping
to pick it up, leaped upon his horse and joined
in the inglorious retreat. On, on, dashed the
men until they reached the town of Jasper, tired
and provoked. Like many other men, North or
South, they were brave enough when it came to
gunpowder, but were quickly vanquished at the
idea of pestilential disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; cried the leader, as they all reined up
in front of the village tavern, which now looked
dark and uninviting; &#8220;those three spies, if spies
they are, can go to Guinea for all I care. I shall
hunt them no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general murmur of assent to this
fervent remark. One of the Vigilants said, in an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
injured tone: &#8220;I wish Jake Hare was at the
bottom of the ocean!&#8221;</p>
<p>In explanation of which charitable sentiment
it may be explained that Farmer Hare, on the
departure of Watson, Macgreggor and George
Knight, had run all the way to Jasper. Here he
told the Vigilants that the three men had returned
in the boat (which he had previously
declared they had taken) and landed on the bank
of the river. They could be easily caught, he
said. He carefully suppressed any account of the
way in which he had been outwitted by Watson.
The fact was that Hare made up his mind, logically
enough, that the fugitives would keep along
the Tennessee until morning came, and as he had
seen the direction they had taken he determined
to set the Vigilants on their track. His scheme,
as we have seen, was nearly crowned with success.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;A miss is as good as a mile,&#8221; laughed Watson,
as he stood with his two companions in the
pitch black interior of the cabin, listening to the
last faint sounds of the retreating Vigilants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like smallpox, eh?&#8221; said
George.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Or nothing like a boy who can imitate a
darky&#8217;s voice,&#8221; put in Macgreggor. &#8220;Where
did you learn the art, George?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We boys in Cincinnati had a minstrel company
of our own,&#8221; the boy explained, &#8220;and I
used to play negro parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never call the minstrels stupid again,&#8221;
said Watson. &#8220;They have been instrumental in
saving our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather say it was your own brains that did
it,&#8221; interposed George.</p>
<p>So they talked until daybreak, for they found
it impossible to sleep. Meanwhile the weather
had changed. When the sun came peeping over
the horizon, between tearful clouds, as if afraid
that it was almost too damp for him to be out,
the trio were pushing cautiously along the bank
of the Tennessee, in the direction of Chattanooga.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who brought the Vigilants out
for us the second time, unless it was our dear
friend Hare, and I don&#8217;t know whether they will
give us another chase this morning,&#8221; said Watson,
as they were laboriously ascending one of
the mountain spurs which led down to the river
shore, &#8220;but we must go steadily on, and trust to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
luck. To delay would be fatal. This is Friday&mdash;and
we must be in Marietta by this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>On they trudged, over rocks and paths that
would have taxed the ability of a nimble-footed
chamois, as they wondered how the rest of their
friends were faring, and where might be the intrepid
Andrews. Sometimes Waggie scampered
joyously on; sometimes he reposed in his master&#8217;s
overcoat. The clouds had now cleared
away; the sun was shining serenely over the
swollen and boisterous waters of the crooked
Tennessee. Nature was once more preparing to
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting frightfully hungry,&#8221; cried
George, about noon-time. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind
a bit of breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where we may get some,&#8221; said Macgreggor.
He pointed to an old-fashioned colonial
house of brick, with a white portico, which
they could see in the centre of a large open tract
about a quarter of a mile back of the river. The
smoke was curling peacefully from one of the
two great chimneys, as if offering a mute invitation
to a stranger to enter the house and partake
of what was being cooked within. In a field in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
front of the mansion cattle were grazing, and the
jingle of their bells sounded sweetly in the distance.
No one would dream, to look at such an
attractive picture, that the grim Spectre of War
stalked in the land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we go up to the house, and ask for
something?&#8221; suggested Macgreggor, who was
blessed with a healthy appetite.</p>
<p>Watson looked a little doubtful. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no use in our showing ourselves any more than
is necessary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Rather than risk our
necks, we had better go on empty stomachs till
we reach Chattanooga.&#8221;</p>
<p>But such a look of disappointment crept over
the faces of George and Macgreggor, and even
seemed to be reflected in the shaggy countenance
of Waggie, that Watson relented.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s no reason why
there should be any more danger here than in
Chattanooga or Marietta. Let&#8217;s make a break
for the house, and ask for a meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken before they were all
three hurrying towards the mansion. When at
last they stood under the portico, George seized
the quaint brass knocker of the front door, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
gave it a brisk rap. After some delay a very fat
negress opened the door, and eyed the strangers
rather suspiciously. Their tramp over the country
had not improved their appearance, and her
supercilious, inquisitive look was not strange,
under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you folks want?&#8221; she asked, putting
her big arms akimbo in an uncompromising
attitude. Watson was about to reply when an
attractive voice, with the soft accent so characteristic
of the Southerners, called: &#8220;What is it,
Ethiopia? Any one to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The next instant a kindly-faced gentlewoman
of about fifty stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything I can do for you?&#8221; she
asked pleasantly.</p>
<p>Macgreggor proceeded to tell the customary
story about their being on their way from Kentucky
to join the Confederate army further
south. His heart smote him as he did so, for
she was so gentle and sympathetic in her manner
that he loathed to practice any deception, however
necessary; but there was no help for it.
So he ended by asking for something to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said the mistress of the mansion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
for such she proved to be, &#8220;and take any poor
hospitality I can offer you. My husband, Mr.
Page, and both my children are away, fighting
under General Lee, and I am only too glad to do
anything I can for others who are helping the
great cause.&#8221; She smiled sweetly at George, and
patted his dog. The boy regarded her almost
sheepishly; he, too, hated the idea of imposing on
so cordial a hostess.</p>
<p>Mrs. Page led the party into a great colonial
hallway, embellished with family portraits.
&#8220;By-the-way,&#8221; she added, &#8220;there is a Confederate
officer in the house now&mdash;Major Lightfoot,
of the &mdash;th Virginia Regiment. He reached
here this morning from Richmond and goes to
Chattanooga this afternoon on a special mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson bit his lip. &#8220;We&#8217;re coming to too
close quarters with the enemy,&#8221; he thought, and
he felt like retreating from the mansion with his
companions. But it was too late. Such a move
would only excite suspicion, or, worse still,
lead to pursuit. &#8220;We must face the thing
through,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;and trust to our wits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Page ushered the strangers, including the
delighted Waggie, into a large, handsomely paneled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
dining-room on the left of the hallway.
She made them gather around an unset table.
&#8220;Sit here for a few minutes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and the
servants will bring you the best that Page
Manor can offer you. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll send
Major Lightfoot to see you. He may be able to
help you in some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed the door and was gone. &#8220;I wish
this Major Lightfoot, whoever he is, was in Patagonia
at the present moment,&#8221; whispered Watson.
&#8220;It&#8217;s easy enough to deceive the Southern country
bumpkins, and make them think you are Confederates,
but when you get among people with
more intelligence, like officers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference does it make?&#8221; interrupted
Macgreggor, looking longingly at a mahogany
sideboard. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear Mrs. Page say the
Major was a Virginian? He doesn&#8217;t know anything
about Kentucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s lucky,&#8221; laughed Watson, &#8220;for we
don&#8217;t either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; came the warning from George.
The door opened, and several negro servants began
to bring in a cold dinner. What a meal it
was too, when the time came to partake of it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and how grateful the three hungry travelers felt
to the mistress of the house. When it had been
disposed of, and the servants had left the dining-room,
George said, almost under his breath:
&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better be off? We have a good
number of miles yet, between here and Marietta.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson was about to rise from the table when
the door opened to admit a tall, stalwart man of
about thirty, whose cold, gray-blue eyes and resolute
mouth denoted one who was not to be trifled
with. He was dressed in the gray uniform of a
Confederate officer, but he had, presumably, left
his sword and pistols in another room. The visitors
stood up as he entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, my men,&#8221; he said, shaking
hands with each one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Major Lightfoot?&#8221; asked Watson,
trying to look delighted, but not making a brilliant
success of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the Major. &#8220;I hear you boys
are Kentuckians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; said Macgreggor stoutly; &#8220;we are
ready to die for our country, and so we are journeying
southward to enlist.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pretty young chap to take up arms,&#8221;
observed the Major, eyeing George keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One is never too young to do that,&#8221; answered
the boy. He was determined to put a bold face
on the affair, and he saw no reason why the Confederate
officer should suspect him if he spoke
up unhesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The South has need of all her loyal sons,&#8221;
remarked Watson, who felt no compunction in
deceiving the Major, whatever might have been
his sentiments as to hoodwinking Mrs. Page.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you all come from Kentucky?&#8221; went on
the officer. &#8220;That interests me, for I come from
Kentucky myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>The jaws of the three strangers dropped simultaneously.
Had a bomb fallen at their feet
they could not have been more disconcerted.
What did they know about Kentucky, if they
had to be put through a series of cross-questions
by a native! But there was no reason, after all,
why the Major should dwell on the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Mrs. Page said you belonged to a
Virginia regiment,&#8221; exclaimed Macgreggor, almost
involuntarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I do,&#8221; replied the Major, &#8220;but I only settled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
in Virginia two years ago. I was born and
bred in Kentucky, and there&#8217;s no state like it&mdash;now
is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried the trio, with a well-feigned attempt
at enthusiasm. They felt that they were
treading on dangerous ground, and resolved to
play their parts as well as they could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you all come from the same part of Kentucky?&#8221;
queried the Major, as he sat down on a
chair, evidently prepared for a pleasant chat.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Fleming County,&#8221; said Watson carelessly,
quite as if he knew every other county in
the State. &#8220;I fear, sir, we must be moving on
towards Chattanooga. We are in a hurry to enlist,
and we have already been delayed too
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Major completely ignored the latter part
of this sentence. &#8220;From Fleming County,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s pleasant news. I know
Fleming County like a book. There is where my
father lived and died. What part of the county
do you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Had the Major asked them to tell the area of
the United States in square inches he could not
have propounded a more puzzling question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dunder and blitzen;&#8221; thought Watson. &#8220;If
I only knew more of Kentucky geography I
might get myself out of this scrape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We come from the southeastern part of the
county,&#8221; said Macgreggor, after an awkward
pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Near what town?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another pause. Oh, for the name of a town
in the southeastern part of Fleming County, Kentucky.
The Major was looking at the visitors
curiously. Why this sudden reticence on their
part?</p>
<p>At last Watson spoke up, although evasively.
&#8220;We were a long distance from any town; we
worked on adjoining farms, and when the call to
arms came we determined to rush to the rescue
of our beloved Southland.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Major gave Watson one searching look.
&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said he, &#8220;that&#8217;s all very pretty, and
I&#8217;m glad you are so patriotic&mdash;but that won&#8217;t
do. What is the nearest town to the places you
live in?&#8221;</p>
<p>The name of Carlisle flashed through Watson&#8217;s
mind. He recalled that it was somewhere in the
part of Kentucky in which Fleming County was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
situated. A man he knew had once lived there.
He would risk it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nearest town is Carlisle,&#8221; he said shortly.
&#8220;And now, Major, we really must be off! Good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>He started for the door, followed by George
and Macgreggor, who were both devoutly wishing
that such a state as Kentucky had never existed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a second,&#8221; suddenly commanded the
Southerner, stepping in front of the door to bar
the way. &#8220;You seem to be strangely ignorant
of your own county. Carlisle happens to be in
the adjoining county.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, sir, we&#8217;re not here to be examined by
you, as if we were in the witness box,&#8221; cried
Watson, who hoped to carry the situation through
with a strong hand. He would try a little
bluster.</p>
<p>A sarcastic smile crossed the firm face of Major
Lightfoot. &#8220;Don&#8217;t try to bluff me,&#8221; he said
quietly but sternly; &#8220;for it won&#8217;t work. I see
very clearly that you fellows have never been in
Fleming County, nor do I think you have ever
been in Kentucky at all, for the matter of that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
You certainly talk more like Yankees than Kentuckians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t believe us?&#8221; asked Macgreggor,
trying to assume an air of injured innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; answered the Major. He
folded his arms, and regarded the visitors as if
he were trying to read their inmost thoughts.
&#8220;You are lying to me! And as you&#8217;ve lied to
me about coming from Kentucky, it&#8217;s quite as
likely you&#8217;ve lied to me about your being on your
way to enlist in the Confederate army. For all
I know you may be Union spies. In short, my
friends, you are acting in the most suspicious
way, and I put you under arrest!&#8221;</p>
<p>George&#8217;s heart sank within him. He was not
afraid of being arrested, but to think that he
might never take part in the bridge-burning expedition.
Lightfoot turned the key in the door.</p>
<p>Watson walked up to the Major, and tapped
him on the shoulder. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, in
the tone of a man who is quite sure of his position.
&#8220;You talk about putting us under arrest,
but you&#8217;re only playing a game of bluff yourself.
We are three to your one&mdash;and I&#8217;d like to know
what is to prevent our walking out of this house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
and knocking you down, too&mdash;or, if you prefer,
shooting you&mdash;if you attempt to stop us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lightfoot laughed, in a superior sort of way.
&#8220;Go, if you want,&#8221; he said curtly; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t
think you&#8217;ll go very far.&#8221; His eyes glistened, as
if he thought the whole scene rather a good joke.
&#8220;Half a mile back of this mansion there&#8217;s a squadron
of Confederate cavalry picketed. If I give
them the alarm they&#8217;ll scour the whole countryside
for you, and you&#8217;ll all be in their hands
within an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson turned pale. It was the paleness of
vexation rather than of fear. &#8220;Why were we
fools enough to come to this house,&#8221; he thought.
He knew how quickly they could be caught by
cavalrymen.</p>
<p>The Major smiled in a tantalizing manner. &#8220;I
think you will take my advice and surrender,&#8221; he
said, sitting down carelessly in a chair and swinging
one of his long legs over the other. &#8220;If, on
investigation, it proves that you are not spies,
you will be allowed to go on your way. If there&#8217;s
any doubt about it, however, you will be sent to
Richmond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macgreggor, with a bound, leaped in front of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
the Confederate, and, pulling out a revolver,
pointed it at Lightfoot&#8217;s head. &#8220;Unless you
promise not to have us followed, you shan&#8217;t leave
this room alive!&#8221; he cried with the tone of a man
daring everything for liberty. George fully expected
to see the officer falter, for he had seen
that the Major was unarmed.</p>
<p>But Lightfoot did nothing of the kind. On
the contrary, he gave one of his provoking
laughs. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go into heroics,&#8221; he said, pushing
Macgreggor away as though he were &#8220;shoohing&#8221;
off a cat. &#8220;You know I would promise
anything, and the second your backs were turned
I&#8217;d give the alarm. You don&#8217;t think I would be
fool enough to see you fellows walking away
without making a trial to get you back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Macgreggor hesitated, as he looked at George
and Watson. Then he answered fiercely, handling
his pistol ominously the meanwhile:
&#8220;We&#8217;ve but one chance&mdash;and we&#8217;ll take it! We
will never let you leave this room alive, promise
or no promise. You are unarmed, and there are
<i>three</i> of us, armed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Major did not seem to be at all startled.
He merely changed the position of his legs, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
answered: &#8220;Killing me wouldn&#8217;t do you any
good, my boy! If you do shoot me before I can
escape from the room the shooting would only
alarm the house&mdash;the cavalry would be summoned
by Mrs. Page, and you would find yourself
worse off even than you are now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson touched Macgreggor on the shoulder.
&#8220;The Major&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we would only
be shooting down a man in cold blood, and
gaining nothing by it. He has trapped us&mdash;and,
so long as those plagued cavalrymen are so
near, we had better submit. I think I&#8217;ve got as
much courage as the next man, but I don&#8217;t believe
in butting one&#8217;s head against a stone wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macgreggor sullenly replaced his pistol. He
could not but see the force of Watson&#8217;s reasoning.
The Major rose to his feet. He was smiling
away again, as if he were enjoying himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We surrender!&#8221; announced Watson with a
woebegone expression on his strong face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; said Lightfoot, &#8220;that I was
too clever for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer. George picked up
Waggie. &#8220;Can I take my dog along with us,
wherever we go?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>The Major suddenly advanced towards George,
and patted the tiny animal. &#8220;Hello! Waggie,
how are you, old man?&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>George gasped. &#8220;How on earth did you know
Waggie&#8217;s name?&#8221; he asked. For Waggie had
been chewing at a bone on the floor ever
since the entrance of the Confederate, and his
master had not addressed a word to him during
that time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know his name almost as well as I do
yours, George Knight,&#8221; said Lightfoot.</p>
<p>In his excitement George dropped Waggie
on a chair. The three Northerners heard this
last announcement with open-mouthed astonishment.</p>
<p>Lightfoot burst into a great laugh that made
the mystery the more intense. &#8220;Why, comrades,&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;I ought to go on the stage; I
had no idea I was such a good actor. Don&#8217;t you
know your friend, Walter Jenks?&#8221; The Southern
accent of the speaker had suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>The listeners stood dumfounded. Then the
whole situation dawned upon them. They had
been most gloriously and successfully duped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
This Major Lightfoot was none other than Walter
Jenks, a sergeant from General Mitchell&#8217;s
camp, whom Andrews had sent out on the bridge-burning
party. He had shaved off his beard,
and assumed a Southern accent (something he
was able to do because he was a Marylander), so
that the guests at the Page mansion had failed to
recognize him.</p>
<p>Jenks shook the three warmly by the hand.
&#8220;It was a mean trick to play on you fellows,&#8221; he
explained, lowering his voice, &#8220;but for the life
of me I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How on earth did you turn up here in the
guise of a Confederate officer?&#8221; asked Watson,
who now felt a sense of exhilaration in knowing
that he might yet join Andrews at Marietta.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too long a story to tell,&#8221; whispered
Jenks. &#8220;I&#8217;ll only say here that I got lost from
the other two fellows I was traveling with&mdash;was
suspected of being a spy in one of the villages I
passed through&mdash;and, to avoid pursuit, had to
shave off my beard and disguise myself in this
Confederate uniform, which I was lucky enough
to &#8216;appropriate.&#8217; I was nearly starved&mdash;stumbled
across this place or my way down&mdash;told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
a plausible story (Heaven forgive me for deceiving
so delightful a lady as Mrs. Page)&mdash;and
here I am! And the sooner we set off from here,
the sooner we will meet at the appointed town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When the war&#8217;s over,&#8221; remarked Macgreggor,
&#8220;you can earn a fortune on the stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later the four Northerners had
taken a grateful farewell of the unsuspecting
Mrs. Page, and were hurrying along the bank of
the Tennessee. By four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon
they had reached a point directly opposite Chattanooga.
Here they found a ferryman, just as
they had been given to expect, with his flat
&#8220;horse-boat&#8221; moored to the shore. He was a
fat, comfortable-looking fellow, as he sat in tailor-fashion
on the little wharf, smoking a corncob
pipe as unconcernedly as though he had nothing
to do all day but enjoy tobacco.</p>
<p>Watson approached the man. &#8220;We want to
get across the river as soon as possible,&#8221; he explained,
pointing to his companions. &#8220;This
officer (indicating Walter Jenks, who retained
his Confederate uniform) and the rest of us must
be in Chattanooga within half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ferryman took his pipe from his mouth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
and regarded the party quizzically. &#8220;You may
want to be in Chattanooga in half an hour,&#8221; he
said, in a drawling, lazy fashion, &#8220;but I reckon
the river&#8217;s got somethin&#8217; to say as to that!&#8221; He
waved one hand slowly in the direction of the
stream, which was, without a shadow of doubt,
an angry picture to gaze upon. Its waters were
turbulent enough to suggest that a passage across
them at this moment would be attended by great
risk.</p>
<p>But to the anxious travelers any risk, however
great, seemed preferable to waiting. If they
missed the evening train from Chattanooga to
Marietta their usefulness was ended. No bridge-burning
adventure for them!</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you we <i>must</i> get over to-night,&#8221; urged
Jenks, who hoped that his uniform would give
him a certain prestige in the eyes of the ferryman.
&#8220;I am Major Lightfoot, of the &mdash;th
Virginia, and I&#8217;m on an important mission.
Every minute is precious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be true enough, Colonel,&#8221; replied
the man, ignoring the title of &#8220;major,&#8221; and
taking a whiff from his pipe. &#8220;That may be
true enough, but I calculate nature&#8217;s got somethin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
to say in this world. And I calculate I
ain&#8217;t a-going to risk my life, and the happiness
of my wife and five children, by tryin&#8217; to stem
the Tennessee in this turmoil.&#8221;</p>
<p>George&#8217;s heart sank within him. To be so
near the realization of his dream of adventure,
and to be stopped at the eleventh hour by this
stupid, cautious boatman! Waggie, who had
been frisking near him, suddenly became
solemn.</p>
<p>Watson pulled from his coat a large pack of
Confederate money. &#8220;There&#8217;s money for you,&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll take us over!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ferryman eyed him in a sleepy way, and
took another pull at that provoking pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Money!&#8221; he said, after a long pause, during
which the Northerners gazed at him as if their
very lives depended on his decision. &#8220;Money!
What&#8217;s the use to me of money, if we all get
drowned crossing over?&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke the river roared and rushed downwards
on its course with a heedlessness that
quite justified him in his hesitation. &#8220;Wait till
to-morrow morning, and the Tennessee will be
quieter. Then I&#8217;ll help you out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till doomsday, why don&#8217;t you say?&#8221;
thundered Jenks. &#8220;We must take the risk&mdash;and
I order you to take us over, at once!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be a very big man in the army,&#8221;
answered the ferryman, &#8220;but your orders don&#8217;t
go here!&#8221; He produced a small tin box from
the tail of his coat, leisurely poured from it into
his pipe some strong tobacco, and slowly lighted
the stuff. Then he arose, walked to the edge of
the wharf, and beckoned to a lad of nine or ten
years old who was half asleep in the boat. The
boy jumped up, leaped upon the wharf, and ran
off along the river&#8217;s bank in the opposite direction
from which the four strangers had come. He
had received a mysterious order from the ferryman.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; asked Macgreggor,
who had a strong desire to knock down this
imperturbable fellow who refused to be impressed
even by a Confederate uniform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied the man, stolidly. He sat
down again, crossed his legs, and took a long
pull at the pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last time,&#8221; shouted Jenks, shaking
his fist in the smoker&#8217;s face, &#8220;I order you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
to take out that boat, and ferry us across the
river!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last time,&#8221; said the man, very calmly,
&#8220;I tell you I&#8217;m not going to risk my life for four
fools!&#8221;</p>
<p>George walked up closer to Watson, and whispered:
&#8220;Let&#8217;s seize the boat, and try to cross
over ourselves!&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson beckoned to his two companions, and
told them what the boy suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be taking our lives in our hands,&#8221;
said Jenks, &#8220;but anything is better than being
delayed here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; added Macgreggor, &#8220;although the
river <i>is</i> pretty mischievous-looking, I don&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s any more dangerous than waiting
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenks took out his watch, and looked at it.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you just five minutes,&#8221; he said, addressing
the ferryman, &#8220;and if by that time you
haven&#8217;t made up your mind to take us over the
river, we&#8217;ll take the law into our own hands,
seize your boat, and try the journey ourselves.&#8221;
Waggie began to bark violently, as if he sympathized
with this speech.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>The man smiled. &#8220;That will be a fool trick,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;If it&#8217;s dangerous for me, it&#8217;ll be
death for you uns. Better say your prayers,
partner!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only four minutes left!&#8221; cried Jenks, resolutely,
keeping an eye on the watch.</p>
<p>The ferryman closed his eyes and resumed his
smoking. The others watched him intently.
Meanwhile George was thinking. Two minutes
more passed. The boy was recalling a saying of
his father&#8217;s: &#8220;Sometimes you can taunt an obstinate
man into doing things, where you can&#8217;t
reason with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time is up!&#8221; said Jenks, at last. &#8220;Come,
boys, let&#8217;s make a break for the boat!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ferryman placed his pipe on the ground
with the greatest composure. &#8220;Take the boat
if you want,&#8221; he observed, rising to his feet,
&#8220;but you fellows won&#8217;t get very far in it! Look
there!&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed up the river&#8217;s bank. The boy who
had been sent away a few minutes before was
coming back to the wharf; he was now, perhaps,
a quarter of a mile away, but he was not alone.
He was bringing with him five Confederate soldiers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
who were walking briskly along with
muskets at right shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows looked kind o&#8217; troublesome,&#8221; explained
the ferryman, &#8220;so as there&#8217;s a picket up
yonder I thought I&#8217;d send my son up for &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson made a move towards the boat.
&#8220;Better stay here,&#8221; cried the ferryman; &#8220;for
before you can get a hundred feet away from
the bank in this contrary stream those soldiers
will pick you off with their muskets. D&#8217;ye want
to end up as food for fishes?&#8221;</p>
<p>The men groaned in spirit. &#8220;It&#8217;s too late,&#8221;
muttered Jenks. He could picture the arrival at
Marietta of all the members of the expedition
save his own party, and the triumphal railroad
escapade the next day. And when the Northern
newspapers would ring with the account of the
affair, his own name would not appear in the list
of the brave adventurers.</p>
<p>Suddenly George went up to the ferryman,
and said, with much distinctness: &#8220;I see we
have to do with a coward! There&#8217;s not a boatman
in Kentucky who wouldn&#8217;t take us across
this river. Even a Yankee wouldn&#8217;t fear it.
But you are so afraid you&#8217;ll have to get your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
feet wet that you actually send for soldiers to
protect you!&#8221;</p>
<p>George&#8217;s companions looked at him in astonishment.
The boatman, losing his placidity,
turned a deep red. &#8220;Take care, young fellow,&#8221;
he said, in a voice of anger; &#8220;there&#8217;s not a man
in Tennessee who dares to call Ned Jackson a
coward!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare to call you a coward unless you take
us over to Chattanooga!&#8221; answered the boy,
sturdily. &#8220;You&#8217;re afraid&mdash;and that&#8217;s the whole
truth!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson&#8217;s face now underwent a kaleidoscopic
transformation ranging all the way from red to
purple, and then to white. All his stolidity had
vanished; he was no longer the slow countryman;
he had become the courageous, impetuous
Southerner.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you weren&#8217;t a boy,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I&#8217;d
knock you down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t prove your bravery,&#8221; returned
George, regarding him with an expression of
well-feigned contempt. &#8220;That would only show
you to be a bully. If you have any courage in
your veins&mdash;the kind of courage that most Southerners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
have&mdash;prove it by taking us across the
river.&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldiers were gradually drawing near the
wharf. Meanwhile George&#8217;s companions had
caught his cue. He was trying to goad Jackson
into ferrying them over the riotous stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Macgreggor; &#8220;a good boatman
is never afraid of the water; but our friend
here seems to have a consuming fear of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to live on a farm, where there is
nothing but a duck pond in the shape of water,&#8221;
added Jenks. Jackson was actually trembling
with rage; his hands were twisting nervously.</p>
<p>Watson eyed him with seeming pity, as he
said: &#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky thing for you that you didn&#8217;t
enlist in the Confederate army. You would have
run at the first smell of gunpowder!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson could contain his wrath no longer.
&#8220;So you fellows think I&#8217;m a coward,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Very well! I&#8217;ll prove that I&#8217;m not! Get into
my boat, and I&#8217;ll take you across&mdash;or drown you
all and myself&mdash;I don&#8217;t care which. But no man
shall ever say that Ned Jackson is a coward!&#8221;
He ran to the boat, leaped into it and beckoned
to the Northerners. &#8220;Come on!&#8221; he shouted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Within a minute George, Macgreggor, Watson
and Jenks were in the little craft, and the ferryman
had unmoored it from the wharf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he cried, waving his hand to
the soldiers, who had now reached the wharf.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you. I&#8217;m going to ferry &#8217;em over
the river&mdash;or go to the bottom! It&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already were the voyagers in midstream, almost
before they knew it. It looked as if Jackson,
in his attempt to prove his courage, might
only end by sending them all to the bottom.
Waggie, who was now reposing in a pocket of
George&#8217;s coat, suddenly gave a low growl.
George produced from another pocket a bone
which he had brought from Mrs. Page&#8217;s house,
and gave it to the dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Watson, in unconcern, &#8220;if
Wag&#8217;s to be drowned, he&#8217;ll be drowned on a full
stomach&mdash;and that&#8217;s one consolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the only critter among you as has got
any sense,&#8221; snarled the ferryman; &#8220;for he&#8217;s the
only one who didn&#8217;t ask to be taken across this
infarnal river!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>PLOT AND PLOTTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>In after years George could never quite understand
how he and his companions reached the
Chattanooga shore. He retained a vivid recollection
of tempestuous waves, of a boat buffeted
here and there, and of Ned Jackson muttering all
manner of unkind things at his passengers and
the turbulent stream. They did at last reach
their destination, and bade farewell to the ferryman,
whom they loaded down with Confederate
notes.</p>
<p>No sooner was the latter embarked on the return
voyage than Watson said: &#8220;That was a
clever ruse of yours, George. That Jackson was
a brave man at heart, and you put him on his
mettle. He wanted to show us that he wasn&#8217;t
afraid of the water&mdash;and he succeeded.&#8221;</p>
<p>George laughed. He explained that it was a
remark of his father&#8217;s which had put the idea into
his own head, and then he wondered where that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
same father could be. Was he dead or was he
still living, perhaps in some prison?</p>
<p>It was not long before the party reached the
railroad station at Chattanooga. Here they purchased
their tickets for Marietta, and were soon
in the train bound southward for the latter place.
The sun had nearly set as the engine pulled slowly
out of the depot. The car in which they sat was
filled with men on their way down South, some
of them being soldiers in uniform and the rest
civilians. Macgreggor, Watson and Jenks were
at the rear end of the car, while George had to
find a seat at the other end, next to a very thin
man who wore the uniform of a Confederate
captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it strange?&#8221; thought the boy. &#8220;To-morrow
morning we will be reversing our journey on
this railroad, and burning bridges on our way
back to Chattanooga. But how are we to steal a
train? I wonder if Andrews and the rest of the
party will be on hand to-night at Marietta.&#8221;
Then, as he realized that he was in a car filled
with men who would treat him as a spy, if they
knew the nature of his errand to the South, there
came over him a great wave of homesickness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
He had lived all his life among friends; it was
for him a new sensation to feel that he was secretly
opposed to his fellow-travelers.</p>
<p>The thin Captain who sat next to him turned
and curiously regarded Waggie, who was lying
on his master&#8217;s lap. He had shrewd gray eyes,
had this Captain, and there was a week&#8217;s growth
of beard upon his weazened face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get your dog from, lad?&#8221; he
asked, giving Waggie a pat with one of his skeleton-like
hands. It was a pat to which the little
animal paid no attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;From home&mdash;Cincinnati.&#8221;</p>
<p>George had answered on the spur of the moment,
thoughtlessly, carelessly, before he had a
chance to detect what a blunder he was making.
The next second he could have bitten out his
tongue in very vexation; he felt that his face
was burning a bright red; he had a choking sensation
at the throat.</p>
<p>The emaciated Captain was staring at him in a
curiously surprised fashion. &#8220;From Cincinnati?
Cincinnati, Ohio?&#8221; he asked, fixing his lynx-like
eyes attentively upon his companion.</p>
<p>Poor George! Every idea seemed to have left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
him in his sudden confusion; he was only conscious
that the Confederate officer continued to
regard him in the same intent manner. &#8220;I say,&#8221;
repeated the latter, &#8220;is your home in Ohio?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Cincinnati, Ohio,&#8221; said the boy boldly.
&#8220;After all,&#8221; as he thought, &#8220;I had better put a
frank face on this stupidity of mine; a stammering
answer will only make this fellow the more
suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So then you&#8217;re a Northerner, are you, my
son?&#8221; observed the Captain. &#8220;I thought you
spoke with a bit of a Yankee accent!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m a Northerner,&#8221; answered George.
As he felt himself plunging deeper and deeper
into hot water he was trying to devise some
plausible story to tell the officer. But how to
invent one while he was being subjected to that
close scrutiny. One thing, at least, was certain.
Once he had admitted that his home was in Ohio
he could not make any use of the oft repeated
Kentucky yarn.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are you doing down here?&#8221; asked
the Captain. He spoke very quietly, but there
was an inflection in his voice which seemed to
say: &#8220;Give a good account of yourself&mdash;for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
your presence in this part of the country is curious,
if nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>George understood that he must think quickly,
and decide on some plan of action to cover up, if
he could, any bad results from his blunder. He
was once more cool, and he returned the piercing
look of the officer with steadfast eyes. His mind
was clear as to one thing. There was no need of
his trying to invent a story, on the spur of the
moment, with a man like the Captain quite ready
to pick it to pieces. For it was plain that this
Confederate was shrewd&mdash;and a trifle suspicious.
The boy must pursue a different course.</p>
<p>&#8220;My being down South is my own concern,&#8221;
he said, pretending to be virtuously offended at
the curiosity of his inquisitor.</p>
<p>The Captain drew himself up with an injured
air. &#8220;Heigh ho!&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;my young infant
wants me to mind my own business, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>George flushed; he considered himself very
much of a man, and he did not relish being called
an &#8220;infant.&#8221; But he kept his temper; he foresaw
that everything depended upon his remaining
cool. He treated the remark with contemptuous
silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>The officer turned away from him, to look out
of the window of the car. Yet it was evident
that he paid little or no attention to the rapidly
moving landscape. He was thinking hard. Not
a word was spoken between the two for ten
minutes. Most of the other passengers were
talking excitedly among themselves. Occasionally
a remark could be understood above the rattle
of the train. George heard enough to know
they were discussing the battle of Shiloh, which
had been fought so recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; cried a soldier, &#8220;the battle was a
great Confederate victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; answered some one, &#8220;but if
we have many more such victories we Southerners
will have a lost cause on our hands, and Abe
Lincoln will be eating his supper in Richmond
before many months are gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this there was a chorus of angry dissent,
and several cries of &#8220;Traitor!&#8221; George listened
eagerly. He would dearly have liked to look behind
him, to see what his three companions were
doing, or hear what they were saying, at the
other end of the car. But he was not supposed
to know them. He could only surmise (correctly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
enough, as it happened) that they were acting
their part of Southerners, although doing as little
as possible to attract attention. One thing
worried the young adventurer. He distrusted the
continued silence of the Captain.</p>
<p>It was a silence that the officer finally broke,
by looking squarely into George&#8217;s face, and saying,
in a low tone: &#8220;When a Northerner travels
down South these times he must give an account
of himself. If you won&#8217;t tell me who you are,
my friend, I may find means of making you!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke the train was slowing up, and in
another minute it had stopped at a little station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now or never,&#8221; thought George. He arose,
stuffed Waggie into his pocket, and said to the
Captain: &#8220;If you want to find out about me,
write me. This is my station. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next instant he had stepped out of the
car, and was on the platform. He and an elderly
lady were the only two passengers who alighted.
No sooner had they touched the platform than
the train moved on its way, leaving the Captain
in a state of angry surprise, as he wondered
whether he should not have made some effort to
detain the boy. It was too late to do anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
now, and the officer, as he is carried away on the
train, is likewise carried out of our story.</p>
<p>What were the feelings of Watson, and Jenks,
and Macgreggor as they saw George leave the
car, and the train rattled away? They were
afraid to make any sign; and even if they had
thought it prudent to call out to the lad, or seek
to detain him, they would not have found time
to put their purpose into execution, so quickly
had the whole thing happened. Not daring to
utter a sound, they could only look at one another
in blank amazement. &#8220;What was the boy
up to,&#8221; thought Watson, &#8220;and what&#8217;s to become
of him?&#8221; He was already devotedly attached
to George, so that he felt sick at heart when he
pictured him alone and unprotected at a little
wayside village in the heart of an enemy&#8217;s country.
Nor were the other two men less solicitous.
Had George suddenly put on wings, and flown
up through the roof of the car, they could not
have been more horrified than they were at this
moment. Meanwhile the train went rumbling
on, as it got farther and farther away from the
little station. It was now almost dark; the
brakeman came into the car and lighted two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
sickly lamps. Some of the passengers leaned
back in their seats and prepared to doze, while
others, in heated, angry tones, kept up the discussion
as to the battle of Shiloh. The civilian
who had hinted that the engagement was not a
signal victory for the Confederates got up and
walked into a forward car, to rid himself of the
abuse and arguments of several of his companions.</p>
<p>Watson was sorely tempted to pull the check
rope of the train, jump out, and walk back on
the track until he found the missing boy; but
when he reflected on the possible consequences
of such a proceeding he unwillingly admitted to
himself that to attempt it would be the part of
madness. He would only bring the notice of
every one in the train upon himself; suspicion
would be aroused; he and his companions might
be arrested; the whole plot for burning the
bridges might be upset.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can have gotten into George&#8217;s head?&#8221;
he said to himself a hundred times. Jenks and
Macgreggor were asking themselves the same
question. Steadily the train went on, while the
sky grew darker and darker. In time most of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
passengers fell asleep. Occasionally a stop would
be made at some station. Marietta, in Georgia,
would not be reached until nearly midnight.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Where had George gone?&#8221; the reader will
ask. The question is not so hard to answer as it
may seem. The moment that the Captain had
become inquisitive the boy had made up his mind
that the sooner he could get away from that
gentleman the better it would be for the success
of Andrews&#8217; expedition. He saw that the train
stopped at different stations along the road, and
he began to map out a scheme for escape. Thus,
when the cars came to the place already spoken
of, he jumped out, as we have described, and
stood on the platform with the elderly lady who
had alighted almost at the same instant. The
latter passed on into the station, and left the
platform deserted, except for George. Hardly
had she disappeared before the conductor pulled
the check-rope, and the train began to move.
As it slowly passed by him the boy quickly
jumped upon the track, caught hold of the coupling
of the last car, and hung there, with his
knees lifted up almost to his chin. In another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
second he had grasped the iron railing above
him; within a minute he had raised himself and
clambered upon the platform. The train was
now speeding along at the customary rate. As
George sat down on the platform, he gave a sigh
of relief. No one had seen him board the car.
For all that the inquisitive Captain knew he
might still be standing in front of the station.
And what were Watson, Jenks and Macgreggor
thinking about his sudden exit from the scene?
George laughed, in spite of himself, as he pictured
their amazement. He would give them a
pleasant surprise later on, when they reached
Marietta. In the meantime he would stay just
where he was, if he were not disturbed, until
they arrived at that town. Then it would be
late at night, when he could evade the lynx-eyed
Confederate officer.</p>
<p>Having settled his plans comfortably in his
mind George was about to put his hand in his
coat pocket to give a reassuring pat to Waggie
(who had been sadly shaken up by his master&#8217;s
scramble) when the door of the car opened. A
man put out his head, and stared at the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, youngster?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the man. George recognized him as the conductor
of the train.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only trying to get a breath of fresh air,&#8221; replied
the lad, at the same time producing his
railroad ticket and showing it in the dusk. The
conductor flashed the lantern he was holding in
George&#8217;s face, and then glanced at the ticket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t fall off,&#8221; he observed, evidently
satisfied by the scrutiny. &#8220;You were in one of
the forward cars, weren&#8217;t you? Where&#8217;s your
dog? In your pocket, eh?&#8221; He turned around,
shut the door, and went back into the car without
waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;One danger is over,&#8221; whispered George to
himself. Then he began to pat Waggie. &#8220;You
and I are having an exciting time of it, aren&#8217;t
we?&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s one consolation;
they can&#8217;t hang you for a spy, anyway,
even if they should hang me!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the night passed on, as George clung to the
railing of the platform, while the train rumbled
along in the darkness to the Southward. The
conductor did not appear again; he had evidently
forgotten all about the boy. At last,
when Waggie and his master were both feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
cold, and hungry, and forlorn, there came a welcome
cry from the brakeman: &#8220;Marietta! All
out for Marietta!&#8221;</p>
<p>In a short time the passengers for Marietta
had left the train. Watson, Jenks and Macgreggor
were soon in a little hotel near the station,
which was to be the rendezvous for Andrews and
his party. As they entered the office of the
hostelry all their enthusiasm for the coming escapade
seemed to have vanished. The mysterious
disappearance of George had dampened their
ardor; they feared to think where he could be,
or what might have become of him.</p>
<p>The office was brilliantly lighted in spite of the
lateness of the hour. In it were lounging eight
or nine men. The pulses of the three newcomers
beat the quicker as they recognized in
them members of the proposed bridge-burning
expedition. Among them was Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he was saying, in a perfectly natural
manner, to the hotel clerk, who stood behind a
desk; &#8220;we Kentuckians must push on early tomorrow
morning. The South has need of all the
men she can muster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; answered the clerk; &#8220;Abe Lincoln
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
and Jefferson Davis have both found out by
this time that this war won&#8217;t be any child&#8217;s play.
It&#8217;ll last a couple of years yet, or my name&#8217;s not
Dan Sanderson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macgreggor and Jenks walked up to the register
on the desk, without showing any sign of
recognition, and put down their names respectively
as &#8220;Henry Fielding, Memphis, Tennessee,&#8221;
and &#8220;Major Thomas Brown, Chattanooga.&#8221; The
latter, it will be remembered, wore a Confederate
uniform. Watson wrote his real name, in a bold,
round hand, and added: &#8220;Fleming County,
Kentucky.&#8221; Then he turned towards Andrews.
&#8220;Well, stranger,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did I hear you say
you were from Kentucky? I&#8217;m a Kentuckian
myself. What&#8217;s your county?&#8221;</p>
<p>He extended his right hand and greeted Andrews
with the air of a man who would like to
cultivate a new acquaintance. Andrews rose, of
course, to the occasion, by answering: &#8220;I&#8217;m
always glad to meet a man from my own state.
I&#8217;m from Fleming County.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be struck!&#8221; cried Watson. &#8220;That&#8217;s
my county, too! What part of it do you live
in?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>After a little more of this conversation, which
was given in loud tones, the two men withdrew
to a corner and sat down. &#8220;We are all here
now except two of our men,&#8221; said Andrews, in a
low voice. &#8220;Half of the fellows have gone to
bed, thoroughly tired out. But where&#8217;s George?
Isn&#8217;t he with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me sick to think where he is,&#8221; whispered
Watson, &#8220;for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he could finish his sentence George entered
the office, followed by Waggie. He had
lingered about the Marietta Station, after leaving
the platform of the car, until he was safe
from meeting the Captain, in case that gentleman
should have alighted at this place. Then he
had cautiously made his way to the hotel.</p>
<p>Watson rose as quietly as if the appearance of
George was just what he had been expecting.
&#8220;What did you lag behind at the station for,
George?&#8221; he asked. Then, turning to Andrews,
he said: &#8220;Here&#8217;s another Kentuckian, sir&mdash;a
nephew of mine. He wants to join the Confederate
army, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>George, as he shook hands with Andrews quite
as if they had never met each other before, could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
not help admiring the presence of mind of
Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;You young rascal,&#8221; whispered the latter,
&#8220;you have given me some miserable minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; commanded Andrews, in the same
tone of voice. &#8220;We must not talk together any
more. As soon as you go up-stairs to bed you
must come to my room&mdash;number 10, on the second
floor, and get your instructions for to-morrow.
Everything has gone very smoothly so
far, and we are all here excepting two of us, although
some of us have had a pretty ticklish time
in getting through to this town. Remember&mdash;Room
Number 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews moved away. Soon all the members
of the party assembled at the hotel were in their
rooms up-stairs, presumably asleep, with the exception
of George and his three companions.
They were able, after considerable coaxing, to get
admittance into the dining-room. Thereby they
secured a nocturnal meal of tough ham, better
eggs, and some muddy &#8220;coffee.&#8221; The latter was
in reality a concoction consisting of about seven-eights
of chickory, and the other eighth,&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
what the remaining eighth was only the cook
could have told. The meal tasted like a Delmonico
feast to the famished wanderers, nor was
it the less acceptable because they saw it nearly
consumed before their hungry eyes; for Waggie,
who had a power of observation that would have
done credit to a detective, and a scent of which a
hound might well have been proud, made his way
into the dining-room in advance of the party, and
jumped upon the table while the negro waiter&#8217;s
back was turned. As George entered, the dog
was about to pounce upon the large plate of ham.
Mr. Wag cast one sheepish look upon his master,
and then retired under the table, where he had
his supper later on.</p>
<p>After they had finished their meal, the four
conspirators were taken up-stairs by a sleepy bell-boy,
and shown into a large room containing two
double beds. The servant lighted a kerosene
lamp that stood on a centre table, and then shuffled
down to the office.</p>
<p>Macgreggor lifted the lamp to take a survey
of the room. &#8220;Take a good look at those beds,
fellows,&#8221; he said, with a grim chuckle; &#8220;it may
be a long time before you sleep on such comfortable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
ones again. For if we come to grief in this
expedition&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; interrupted Jenks impatiently, but
in subdued tones. &#8220;Don&#8217;t borrow trouble. We
are bound to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macgreggor placed the lamp on the centre table,
and began to take off his shoes. &#8220;I&#8217;m just as
ready as any of you for this scheme,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t shut my eyes to the risks we are
running. Did you notice on your way down that
the railroad sidings between Chattanooga and
Marietta were filled with freight cars? That
means, to begin with, that we won&#8217;t have a clear
track for our operations to the Northward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson smiled rather grimly. &#8220;The more we
appreciate the breakers ahead of us,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;the less likely are we to get stranded on
the beach. But we really can&#8217;t judge anything
about the outlook for to-morrow until we get our
detailed instructions from Andrews.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke there was a very faint tap at the
door. The next moment Andrews had cautiously
entered the room. He was in stocking feet, and
wore neither coat nor waistcoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it better to hunt you fellows up,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
he explained, in a voice that they could just hear,
&#8220;instead of letting you try to find me. I was
listening when the boy showed you up to this
room.&#8221; He proceeded to sit upon one of the beds,
while his companions gathered silently around
him. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and get your instructions
for to-morrow&mdash;for after we separate
to-night there will be no time for plotting.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow we must reverse our journey and
take the early morning train to the northward,
on this Georgia State Railroad. In order to
avoid suspicion, we must not all buy tickets for
the same station. In point of fact we are only
to go as far as Big Shanty station, near the foot
of Kenesaw Mountain, a distance of eight miles.
Here passengers and railroad employees get off
for breakfast, and this is why I have selected the
place for the seizure of the train. Furthermore,
there is no telegraph station there from which
our robbery could be reported. When we board
the train at Marietta we must get in by different
doors, but contrive to come together in one car&mdash;the
passenger car nearest the engine. After
all, or nearly all but ourselves have left the cars
at Big Shanty for breakfast, I will give the signal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
when the coast is clear, and we will begin
the great work of the day&mdash;that of stealing the
locomotive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Andrews went into a detailed description
of what each man in the expedition (he had
now twenty-one men, including himself, and not
counting George) would do when the fateful moment
arrived. George, who sat listening with
open mouth, felt as if he were drinking in a romantic
tale from the &#8220;Arabian Nights,&#8221; or, at
least, from a modern version of the &#8220;Nights,&#8221;
where Federal soldiers and steam engines would
not be out of place. He thrilled with admiration
at the nicety with which Andrews had
made all his arrangements. It was like a general
entering into elaborate preparations for a
battle. The two soldiers who were to act as
engineers, those who were to play brakemen, and
the man who was to be fireman, had their work
carefully mapped out for them. The other men
were to form a guard who would stand near the
cars that were to be seized; they were to have
their revolvers ready and must shoot down any
one who attempted to interfere.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get off as quickly as possible,&#8221; went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
on the intrepid Andrews. &#8220;From what I hear
to-night it is evident that General Mitchell captured
Huntsville to-day, which is one day sooner
than we expected him to do it. We must cut all
telegraph wires and then run the train northward
to Chattanooga, and from there westward
until we meet Mitchell advancing towards Chattanooga
on his way from Huntsville. I have
obtained a copy of the time-table showing the
movement of trains on the Georgia State Railroad,
and I find we have only two to meet on
our race. These two won&#8217;t trouble us, for I
know just where to look for them. There is
also a local freight-train which can be passed if
we are careful to run according to the schedule
of the captured train until we come up to it.
Having gotten by this local freight we can put
on full steam, and speed on to the Oostenaula
and Chickamauga bridges, burn them, and run
on through Chattanooga to Mitchell. There&#8217;s a
glorious plan for you fellows. What do you
think of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a ring of pride in his lowered voice
as he concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirable!&#8221; whispered Walter Jenks, &#8220;It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
a sure thing, and the man who invented the
scheme has more brains than half the generals in
the war!&#8221;</p>
<p>As George pictured to himself the stolen train
flying along the tracks, in the very heart of the
enemy&#8217;s country, he could hardly restrain his enthusiasm.
&#8220;It&#8217;s grand!&#8221; he murmured. Had
he dared he would have given a great
cheer.</p>
<p>The leader smiled as he saw, in the dim lamplight,
the radiant face of the boy. &#8220;You have
lots of grit, my lad,&#8221; he said, in a kindly fashion,
&#8220;and God grant you may come out of this business
in safety.&#8221; Then, turning to Watson, he
asked: &#8220;How does my plan, as now arranged,
impress you, Watson?&#8221;</p>
<p>After a minute&#8217;s silence, during which the
others in the room gazed intently at Watson,
that soldier said: &#8220;I have as great an admiration
for James Andrews as any one of our party,
and I am ready to follow wherever he leads.
Whatever my faults may be, I&#8217;m not a coward.
But we should look carefully on each side of a
question&mdash;and I can&#8217;t help thinking that owing
to circumstances which we have not taken into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
account our expedition stands a very decided
chance of failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are those circumstances?&#8221; asked Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;I find
that there is a large encampment of Confederate
troops at Big Shanty. Escape in a captured
train would have been very easy while those
soldiers were elsewhere; but, being there, do
you suppose that the sentries of the camp will
stand idly by when we seize cars and locomotive
and attempt to steam away to the northward?
In the second place&mdash;and this is no less important&mdash;the
railroad seems to be obstructed by
numerous freight trains, probably not on the
schedule, and flying along the track towards
Chattanooga will not be as plain sailing as you
believe. One unlooked-for delay might be fatal.
We are in the midst of enemies, and should there
be one hitch, one change in our program, the result
will be failure, and perhaps death, for all
of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a painful silence. At last Andrews
said, very quietly, but with an air of strong conviction:
&#8220;I think the very objections you urge,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
my dear Watson, are advantages in disguise. I
know, as well as you, that there&#8217;s a big encampment
at Big Shanty, but what of it? No one
dreams for one second that there is any plot to
capture a train, and no one, therefore, will be on
the lookout. The thing will be done so suddenly
that there will be no chance for an alarm until
we are steaming off from the station&mdash;and then
we can laugh. If we strike any unscheduled
trains, they too will be to our advantage; for
they will make such confusion on the road that
they will detract attention from the rather suspicious
appearance of our own train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; answered Watson,
rather dubiously.</p>
<p>Andrews arose from the bed, and solemnly
shook hands with each of his four companions.
Then he said, very impressively: &#8220;I am confident
of the success of our enterprise, and I will
either go through with it or leave my bones to
bleach in &#8216;Dixieland.&#8217; But I don&#8217;t want to
persuade any one against his own judgment. If
any one of you thinks the scheme too dangerous&mdash;if
you are convinced beforehand of its failure&mdash;you
are at perfect liberty to take the train in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
any direction, and work your way home to the
Union camp as best you can. Nor shall I have
one word of reproach, either in my mind or on
my lips, for a man whose prudence, or whose
want of confidence in his leader, induces him to
draw back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews was an adroit student of men. No
speech could have better served his purpose of
inducing his followers to remain with him. It was
as if he declared: &#8220;You may all desert me, but
<i>I</i> will remain true to my flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can count on me to the very last,&#8221; said
Watson stoutly. He was always ready to face
danger, but he liked to have the privilege of
grumbling at times. In his heart, too, was a conviction
that his leader was about to play a very
desperate game. The chances were all against
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Watson,&#8221; answered Andrews,
gratefully. &#8220;I never could doubt your bravery.
And are the rest of you willing?&#8221;</p>
<p>There were hearty murmurs of assent from
Jenks, George and Macgreggor. Jenks and the
boy were very sanguine; Macgreggor was
rather skeptical as to future success, but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
sternly resolved to banish all doubts from his
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, George,&#8221; said Andrews, as he was
about to leave the room, &#8220;if you get through
this railroad ride in safety you will have something
interesting to remember all your life.&#8221; In
another moment he had gone. The time for
action had almost arrived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ON THE RAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>At an early hour the next morning, just before
daylight, the conspirators were standing on
the platform of the Marietta station, awaiting
the arrival of their train&mdash;the train which they
hoped soon to call theirs in reality. They were
all in civilian dress; even Walter Jenks had contrived
to discard his uniform of a Confederate
officer, regarding it as too conspicuous, and he
was habited in an ill-fitting suit which made
him look like an honest, industrious mechanic.</p>
<p>Andrews was pacing up and down with an
anxious, resolute face. He realized that the
success of the man&oelig;uvre which they were about
to execute rested upon his own shoulders, but he
had no idea of flinching. &#8220;Before night has
come,&#8221; he was thinking confidently, &#8220;we shall
be within the lines of General Mitchell, and soon
all America will be ringing with the story of our
dash.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>George, no less sanguine, was standing near
Watson and Macgreggor, and occasionally slipping
a lump of sugar into the overcoat pocket
which served as a sort of kennel for the tiny
Waggie. There was nothing about the party to
attract undue attention. They pretended, for
the most part, to be strangers one to another,
and, to aid in the deception, they had bought
railroad tickets for different places&mdash;for Kingston,
Adairsville, Calhoun and other stations
to the northward, between Marietta and
Chattanooga.</p>
<p>Soon the train was sweeping up to the platform.
It was a long one, with locomotive,
tender, three baggage cars and a number of
passenger cars. The adventurers clambered on
it through various doors, but at last reached the
passenger car nearest to the engine. Here they
seated themselves quite as if each man had no
knowledge of any one else. In another minute
the train, which was well filled, went rolling away
from Marietta and along the bend around the
foot of Kenesaw Mountain. &#8220;Only eight miles,&#8221;
thought George, &#8220;and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The conductor of the train, a young man with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
a very intelligent face, looked searchingly at the
boy as he examined his ticket. &#8220;Too young,&#8221;
George heard him mutter under his breath, as he
passed on to the other passengers.</p>
<p>A thrill of feverish excitement stirred the lad.
&#8220;What did he mean by too young?&#8221; he asked
himself. &#8220;Can he possibly have gotten wind of
our expedition?&#8221; But the conductor did not
return, and it was not until long afterwards that
George was able to understand what was meant
by the expression, &#8220;Too young.&#8221; The man had
been warned by the Confederate authorities that
a number of young Southerners who had been
conscripted into the army were trying to escape
from service, and might use the cars for that
purpose. He was ordered, therefore, to arrest
any such runaways that he might find. When
he looked at George it is probable that he
thought: &#8220;This boy is too young to be a conscript,&#8221;
and he evidently gave unconscious voice
to what was passing through his mind. Fortunately
enough, he saw nothing suspicious in any
of the Northerners.</p>
<p>The train ran rather slowly, so that it was
bright daylight before it reached Big Shanty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
&#8220;Big Shanty; twenty minutes for breakfast!&#8221;
shouted the conductor and the brakemen.
George&#8217;s heart beat so fast that he almost feared
some one would hear it, and ask him what was
the matter. The hoarse cries of the employees
as they announced the name of the station made
him realize that now, after all these hours of preparation
and preliminary danger, the first act of
his drama of war had begun. Every one of his
companions experienced the same feeling, but,
like him, none had any desire to draw back.</p>
<p>No sooner had the cars come to a standstill
than nearly all the passengers, excepting the
Northerners, quickly left their seats, to repair to
the long, low shanty or eating-room from which
the station took its unpoetic name. Then the
train hands, including the engineer and fireman,
followed the example of the hungry passengers,
and hurried off to breakfast. The engine was
deserted. This was even better than the adventurers
could have hoped, for they had feared
that it might be necessary to overpower the
engineer before they could get away on their
race.</p>
<p>The twenty-one men and the one boy left in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
forward passenger car looked anxiously, guardedly,
at one another. More than one felt in his
clothes to make sure that he had his revolver.
Andrews left the car for half a minute, dropped to
the ground, and glanced rapidly up and down
the track. There was no obstruction visible.
Within a stone&#8217;s throw of him, however, sentries
were posted on the outskirts of the Confederate
camp. He scanned the station, which was directly
across the track from the encampment,
and was glad to see, exactly as he had expected,
that it had no telegraph office from which a dispatch
concerning the coming escapade might be
sent. Having thus satisfied himself that the
coast was clear, and the time propitious, he reentered
the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, boys,&#8221; he said, very calmly (as
calmly, indeed, as if he were merely inviting the
men to breakfast), &#8220;let us go now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The men arose, quietly, as if nothing startling
were about to happen, left the car, and walked
hurriedly to the head of the train. &#8220;Each man
to his post,&#8221; ordered Andrews. &#8220;Ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to write this account
the seizure of the train was accomplished, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
plain view of the puzzled sentries. The two
men who were to act as engineer and assistant
engineer clambered into the empty cab of the
locomotive, as did also Andrews and Jenks.
The latter was to be the fireman. One of the
men uncoupled the passenger cars, so that the
stolen train would consist only of the engine,
tender, and the three baggage cars. Into one of
these baggage cars the majority of the party
climbed, shutting the doors at either end after
them, while the two men who were to serve as
brakemen stationed themselves upon the roof.
Watson and Macgreggor were in this car, while
George, with Waggie in his pocket, was standing
in the tender, his handsome face aglow with
excitement, and his eyes sparkling like stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready! Go!&#8221; cried Andrews. The
engineer opened the valve of the locomotive;
the wheels began to revolve; in another second
the train was moving off towards Chattanooga.
The next instant Big Shanty was in an uproar.
As he peered over the ledge of the tender, and
looked back, George saw the sentries running
here and there, as the passengers in the breakfast-room
came swarming out on the platform.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
There were shouts from many voices; he even
heard the report of several rifles.</p>
<p>But shouts or shots from rifles could not avail
now. The engine was dancing along the track
on the road to Chattanooga; Big Shanty was
soon many yards behind. George took Waggie
out of his pocket, and held him up in the air by
the little fellow&#8217;s forepaws. &#8220;Say good-bye to
the Confeds,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;for by to-night, Wag,
you&#8217;ll be in the Union lines!&#8221; The dog barked
gleefully; and jumped about on the platform of
the tender, glad enough to have a little freedom
again. Then Waggie was replaced in his master&#8217;s
pocket.</p>
<p>Andrews, who was sitting on the right-hand
seat of the cab, looked the picture of delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;How was that for a starter?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good joke on Watson: he was so sure the
sentries would stop us, and the soldiers didn&#8217;t
realize what we were doing until it was too late&mdash;for
them! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was all that the four men in the cab, and
that George in the tender, could possibly do to
keep their balance. The road-bed was very rough
and full of curves; the country was mountainous,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
and the track itself was in wretched condition.
Yet it was a magnificent sight as &#8220;The
General,&#8221; which was the name of the engine,
careered along through the picturesque country
like some faithful horse which tries, with all its
superb powers of muscle, to take its master farther
and farther away from a dangerous enemy.</p>
<p>But suddenly the engine began to slacken its
speed, and at last came to a complete standstill.
Andrews, who had made his way into the tender,
with considerable difficulty, in order to speak to
George, turned a trifle pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Brown?&#8221; he shouted to
the engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fire&#8217;s nearly out, and there&#8217;s no steam,&#8221;
was the rejoinder. At the same moment the
men in the baggage car opened the door nearest
the tender, and demanded to know what had
happened.</p>
<p>Andrews called back to them that there would
only be a short delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the fire that&#8217;s out,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and
I&#8217;m thankful it is nothing worse. When I saw
the train slowing up I was afraid some of the
machinery had broken.&#8221; No one understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
better than he how a broken engine would have
stranded all his men in the enemy&#8217;s country, only
a short distance away, comparatively, from Big
Shanty and the Confederate camp.</p>
<p>George worked with a will in assisting the men
in the cab to convey wood from the tender
into the engine furnace. In three minutes &#8220;The
General&#8221; had resumed its way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; thought George, as the train
twisted around a curve and then sped across a
narrow embankment, &#8220;if any attempt will be
made to follow us.&#8221; But the very idea of such
pursuit seemed absurd.</p>
<p>Andrews turned to Jenks with a smiling countenance.
&#8220;The most difficult part of our journey
is already over,&#8221; he said triumphantly. &#8220;There&#8217;s
only one unscheduled train to meet, in addition
to the two regulars. After I meet it, probably at
Kingston, twenty-five miles or more farther on,
we can put the old &#8216;General&#8217; to full speed, and
begin our work! We have got the upper hand
at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget your telegraph wire is to be
cut,&#8221; said Jenks, as he jammed his shabby cap over
his head, to prevent it from sailing off into space.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a couple of minutes,&#8221; answered the
leader. &#8220;We&#8217;ll cut it.&#8221; He knew that although
there was no telegraph station at Big Shanty,
yet the enemy might tap the wire, if it were not
cut, and thus send word along the line that a
train manned by Northern spies was to be watched
for and peremptorily stopped. The simplest obstruction
on the track would be sufficient to
bring this journey to an untimely end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brown, we&#8217;ll stop here,&#8221; commanded the
leader, a minute or two later, as the engine was
running over a comparatively level section. &#8220;The
General&#8221; was soon motionless, whereupon Watson,
peering out from the baggage car, called out:
&#8220;Anything wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a little wire-cutting to be done,&#8221; shouted
Andrews. Then coming to George, he said:
&#8220;Look here, my boy, how are you on climbing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never had a tree beat me yet,&#8221; said the lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then try your skill at that pole yonder, and
see if you can get to the top of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting to make answer George
handed Waggie to Jenks, jumped from the
tender to the ashy road-bed, and started towards
the nearest telegraph pole, only a few feet away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
from the engine. It was a far more difficult task
to coax one&#8217;s way up a smooth pole than up the
rough bark of a tree, as George soon learned.
Twice he managed to clamber half way up the
pole, and twice he slid ignominiously to the
ground. But he was determined to succeed, and
none the less so because the men in the baggage
car were looking on as intently as if they were
at the circus. Upon making the third attempt he
conquered, and reached the top of the pole amid
the cheering of the spectators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hold on there for a minute, George,&#8221;
called Andrews. He produced from one of his
pockets a ball of very thick twine, or cord, to one
end of which he tied a small stick of kindling-wood,
brought from the tender. Next he leaned
out from the cab and threw the stick into the
air. It flew over the telegraph wire, and then
to the ground, so that the cord, the other end of
which he held in his left hand, passed up across
the wire, and so down again. To the end which
he held Andrews tied a good-sized axe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see what I want?&#8221; he asked the boy,
who was resting himself on the cross-bar supporting
the wire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>George needed no prompting. The cord was
eight or nine feet away from him; to reach it he
must move out on the telegraph wire, hand over
hand, with his feet dangling in the air. Slowly
he swung himself from the cross-bar to the
wire, and began to finger his way towards the
cord. But this was an experience new to the
expert tree-climber; ere he had proceeded more
than three feet his hands slipped and he fell to the
ground. The distance was thirty-five feet or
more, and the lookers-on cried out in alarm.
The boy would surely break his legs&mdash;perhaps
his neck!</p>
<p>But while Master George might not be an
adept in handling a wire he had learned a few
things about falling from trees. As he came
tumbling down he gracefully turned a somersault
and landed, quite unhurt, upon his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it yet,&#8221; he maintained pluckily, running
back to the telegraph pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, George,&#8221; shouted Andrews. He
leaped from the cab, and taking a new piece of
the cord, tied it around the lad&#8217;s waist. &#8220;If I
had the sense I was born with I might have
done that first,&#8221; he muttered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>George began his second ascent of the pole,
and this time reached the top without hindrance
or mishap. Andrews now fastened the axe to
the cord, of which George had one end; in a few
seconds the axe had been drawn up by the boy.
Then, with his left hand holding on to the cross-bar,
and his legs firmly wound around the pole,
he took the axe in his right hand and hit the
wire. Three times did he thus strike; at the
third blow the wire snapped asunder, and the
longer of the two pieces fell to the ground. He
let the tool fall, and slid down the pole as the
men cheered him lustily. Andrews now took
the axe, cut the dangling wire in another place,
and threw the piece thus secured into the
tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t connect that line in a hurry,&#8221; he
said, as he turned to George with the remark:
&#8220;Well, my son, you&#8217;re earning your salt!&#8221;
George, blushing like a peony, felt a thrill of pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, fellows,&#8221; added Andrews, addressing
the men in the baggage car, &#8220;it will be best
to take up a rail, so that if we are pursued, by
any chance, the enemy will have some trouble in
getting on any further.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>The occupants of the car, headed by Watson,
sprang to the ground. Andrews handed him a
smooth iron bar, about four feet in length. &#8220;We
have no track-raising instruments,&#8221; explained the
leader, &#8220;but I guess this will answer.&#8221; Watson
managed to loosen some of the spikes on the
track, in the rear of the train, by means of this
bar; later several of his companions succeeded
in placing a log under the rail and prying it up
so that at last the piece of iron had been entirely
separated from the track.</p>
<p>The perspiration was dripping from Watson&#8217;s
brow. &#8220;Great guns!&#8221; he growled, &#8220;we are
acting as if we had a whole eternity of time before
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; said Andrews, reassuringly,
as he leaped into the cab; &#8220;we have
been running ahead of schedule time. But
hurry up; there&#8217;s lots of work before us!&#8221; In
the next minute the Northerners were once more
on their way.</p>
<p>After the train had run a distance of five
miles, Andrews signaled to the engineer, and it
was brought slowly to a stop. The chief jumped
from the engine, walked along the track to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
end car, and gazed intently to the southward.</p>
<p>&#8220;No sign of pursuit thus far,&#8221; he said to himself.
Then, turning back and speaking to the
men in the baggage car who had once more
opened the door, he cried: &#8220;There&#8217;s time, boys,
for another wrestle with the telegraph&mdash;only
this time we will try a new plan.&#8221; This time,
indeed, a pole was chopped down, and placed
(after the wire had been cut) upon the track
directly behind the last baggage car.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Andrews, &#8220;that will have to be
lifted off before our friends the enemy can steam
by&mdash;even if they have an engine good for seventy
miles an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walter Jenks came walking back to the cab.
He looked pale and tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strained my back a bit in helping the fellows
to put that pole on the track,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back into the car and take a rest,&#8221; urged
the leader. &#8220;George can take your place as fireman.
Eh, George?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy, coming up at that moment, and hearing
the suggestion, smiled almost as broadly as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
the famous Cheshire cat. He longed to know
that he was of some real use in the expedition.
So Jenks retired to the baggage car, carrying
with him, for a temporary companion, the struggling
Waggie, who might be very much in
George&#8217;s way under the new arrangement of
duties.</p>
<p>Off once more rattled &#8220;The General,&#8221; and
George, in his capacity of fireman, felt about
three inches taller than he had five minutes before.
The spirits of Andrews seemed to be
rising higher and higher. Thus far everything
had gone so successfully that he began to believe
that the happy ending of this piece of daring was
already assured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my boys, for a bit of diplomacy,&#8221; he
said, at last, as the occupants of the cab saw that
they were approaching a small station flanked
by half a dozen houses. &#8220;Stop &#8216;The General&#8217;
here, Brown, for I think there&#8217;s a tank at the
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the train reached the platform and slowly
stopped, the station-master, a rustic-looking individual
with a white beard three feet long,
shambled up to the cab.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t this Fuller&#8217;s train?&#8221; he drawled, gazing
curiously at the four Northerners, as he
gave a hitch to his shabby trousers. He could
not understand the presence of the strangers in
the engine, nor the disappearance of the passenger
cars.</p>
<p>Andrews leaned out of the cab window. He
knew that Fuller was the conductor of the stolen
train, whom they had left behind at Big Shanty.
&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, in a tone of authority, &#8220;this is
not Fuller&#8217;s train. He&#8217;ll be along later; we have
the right of way all along the line. I&#8217;m running
a special right through to General Beauregard at
Corinth. He is badly in need of powder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be the powder there?&#8221; asked the station-master,
pointing to the three baggage cars.</p>
<p>The men hiding in one of them had received
their instructions; they were as silent as the
grave, and their doors were closed. The brakemen
sat mute on top of the cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s enough powder in there to blow
up the whole State of Georgia,&#8221; returned Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, I&#8217;d give my shirt and my shoes to
Beauregard if he wanted &#8217;em,&#8221; said the man of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
the long beard. &#8220;He&#8217;s the best General we have
in the Confederate service;&mdash;yes, better even
than Robert Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then help Beauregard by helping me.
I want more water&mdash;I see you have a tank here&mdash;and
more wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have all you can hold,&#8221; cried the
station-master, enthusiastically. He was only
too glad to be of use.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that ten minutes later &#8220;The
General&#8221; was speeding away from the station
with a fresh supply of water and a huge pile of
wood in the tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;That yarn worked admirably, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
asked Andrews. The engineer and his assistant
laughed. George shut the heavy door of the
furnace, into which he had been throwing wood,
and stood up, very red in the face, albeit smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;But even if the story was true,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;you couldn&#8217;t get through to Corinth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; laughed the leader, &#8220;but our goat-bearded
friend at the station didn&#8217;t think of that
fact. Corinth is away off in the state of Mississippi,
near its northern border, nearly three hundred
miles away from here; besides, if I were a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
Southerner, I couldn&#8217;t possibly reach there without
running afoul of General Mitchell and his
forces, either around Huntsville, or Chattanooga.
However, I knew more about Mitchell&#8217;s movements
than the station man did&mdash;and that&#8217;s
where I had the advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We may not have such plain sailing at
Kingston,&#8221; said the engineer, as &#8220;The General&#8221;
just grazed an inquisitive cow which showed
signs of loitering on the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have more people to deal with there,&#8221;
admitted Andrews, &#8220;and we must be all the
more on our guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both the men spoke wisely. It was just two
hours after leaving Big Shanty, and about thirty
miles had been covered, when the alleged powder-train
rolled into the station at the town of
Kingston.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we meet that irregular freight train
here,&#8221; muttered Andrews. There were certainly
plenty of cars in evidence on the sidings; indeed,
the station, which was the junction for a branch
line running to Rome, Georgia, presented a
bustling appearance.</p>
<p>No sooner was &#8220;The General&#8221; motionless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
than a train-dispatcher emerged from a gathering
of idlers on the platform and walked up to
the locomotive. He held in his hand a telegraphic
blank. As he saw Andrews, who was
leaning out of the cab with an air of impatience
that was partly real and partly assumed, the dispatcher
drew back in surprise. He recognized &#8220;The
General,&#8221; but there were strange men in the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought this was Fuller&#8217;s train,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Fuller&#8217;s engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is Fuller&#8217;s engine, but he&#8217;s to follow
me with his regular train and another engine.
This is a special carrying ammunition for General
Beauregard, and I must have the right of
way clear along the line!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dispatcher scanned the train. He saw
nothing to excite his suspicions. The baggage
cars were closed, and might easily be filled with
powder and shot; the men in the engine, and the
two brakemen on the top of one car had a perfectly
natural appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t move on yet,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a telegram saying a local freight from
the north will soon be here, and you must wait
till she comes up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>Andrews bit his lip in sheer vexation. He
had reasoned that this irregular freight train
would already be at Kingston on his arrival, and
he hated the idea of a delay. The loiterers on
the platform were listening eagerly to the conversation;
he felt that he was attracting too
much attention. But there was no help for it.
He could not go forward on this single-track
railroad until the exasperating freight had
reached the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he answered, endeavoring to look
unconcerned, &#8220;shunt us off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within three minutes the train had been
shifted from the main track to a side track, and
a curious crowd had gathered around &#8220;The
General.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a critical situation. The idlers began
to ply the occupants of the cab with a hundred
questions which must be answered in some shape
unless suspicion was to be aroused&mdash;and suspicion,
under such circumstances, would mean
the holding back of the train, and the failure of
the expedition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; &#8220;How much
powder have you got on board?&#8221; &#8220;Why did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
you take Fuller&#8217;s engine?&#8221; &#8220;Why is Beauregard
in such a hurry for ammunition?&#8221; were
among the queries hurled at the defenceless
heads of the four conspirators.</p>
<p>George, as he gazed out upon the Kingstonians,
began to feel rather nervous. He realized that
one contradictory answer, one slip of the tongue,
might spoil everything. And in this case to
spoil was a verb meaning imprisonment and ultimate
death.</p>
<p>A dapper young man, with small, piercing
eyes and a head that suggested a large bump of
self-conceit, called out: &#8220;You chaps can&#8217;t reach
Beauregard. You&#8217;ll run right into the Yankee
forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my orders and I&#8217;m going to try it,&#8221;
doggedly answered Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;And run your ammunition right into the
hands of the Yankees?&#8221; sneered the dapper
young man. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see the sense in
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>An angry flush came into Andrews&#8217; cheeks.
&#8220;When you have been in the Confederate army
a little while, young man, as I have,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll learn to obey orders and ask no questions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
Why don&#8217;t you go serve your country, as
other young men are doing, instead of idling
around at a safe distance from the bullets?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this sally a shout of laughter went up from
the crowd. It was evident that the dapper
young man was not popular. He made no answer,
but went away. &#8220;Will that freight never
turn up?&#8221; thought Andrews.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a barking from the baggage
car nearest the tender, wherein were confined
the majority of the party. George&#8217;s heart
beat the faster as he listened; he knew that the
querulous little cries were uttered by Waggie.</p>
<p>An old man, with snow-white hair and beard,
cried out: &#8220;Is that dog in the car part of your
ammunition?&#8221; His companions laughed at the
witticism. For once Andrews was nonplused.
George came bravely to the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dog in a box,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it&#8217;s a
present to General Beauregard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hopes the purp won&#8217;t be blown up,&#8221;
remarked the old man. There was another
titter, but the story was believed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are getting a little too warm here,&#8221;
Andrews whispered to George. As the words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
left his lips he heard the screeching of a locomotive.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the freight!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, the longed-for freight train;
puffing laboriously, it came up to the station
and was quickly switched off to a siding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we can get rid of these inquisitive hayseeds,&#8221;
said Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; cried George; &#8220;I see a red flag!&#8221;
He pointed to the rear platform of the end
freight car, from which was suspended a piece of
red bunting. Andrews stamped his foot and
indulged in some forcible language. He knew
that the flag indicated the presence of another
train back of the freight.</p>
<p>Andrews was out of the cab like a flash.
&#8220;What does this red flag mean?&#8221; he demanded
of the conductor of the freight train, who
was about to cross the tracks to enter the
station.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does <i>what</i> mean?&#8221; asked the conductor,
in a tone of mild surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is the road blocked up behind you?&#8221;
asked the leader. Had he been the President of
the Southern Confederacy he could not have
spoken more imperiously. &#8220;I have a special
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
train with orders to take a load of powder to
General Beauregard without delay! And here
I find my way stopped by miserable freight
trains which are not a quarter as important as
my three cars of ammunition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sir,&#8221; explained the conductor,
&#8220;but it ain&#8217;t my fault. Fact is, Mitchell, the
Yankee General, has captured Huntsville, and
we&#8217;re moving everything we can out of Chattanooga,
because it&#8217;s said he is marching for there.
We have had to split this freight up into two
sections&mdash;and t&#8217;other section is a few miles
behind. Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;ll be here soon. But,
look here, sir! You&#8217;ll never be able to reach
Beauregard. General Mitchell will get you long
before you are near Corinth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; replied Andrews. &#8220;Mitchell may
have taken Huntsville, but he can&#8217;t stay there.
Beauregard has, no doubt, sent him flying by
this time. And, anyway, I&#8217;m bound to obey
orders from Richmond, come what may.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you luck, sir,&#8221; said the freight conductor,
who was impressed by the authoritative
bearing of Andrews, and believed the spy to be
some Confederate officer of high rank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>The leader returned to the cab. It was still
surrounded by the curious idlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what I call pretty bad railroad management,&#8221;
he grumbled, loud enough to be heard
by the Kingstonians. &#8220;This line should be kept
clear when it&#8217;s necessary to get army supplies
quickly from place to place. What are fifty
freight trains compared to powder for the
troops?&#8221;</p>
<p>The minutes passed slowly; it seemed as if that
second freight train would never come. At last
a dull, rumbling sound on the track gave warning
of the approach of the second section. In a
few moments the heavily-laden cars, drawn by a
large engine, had glided by &#8220;The General,&#8221; down
the main track. The men in the cab gave unconscious
sighs of relief. Now they could move
onward. But what was it that the sharp eyes of
George detected? Yes, there could be no mistake.
At the end of the second freight train
was another red flag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he whispered. Andrews saw the
flag, and turned white.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many more trains are we to wait
for?&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>After regaining his composure he left the
engine, to seek the conductor of the new train.
He was back again in five minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked George.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find from the conductor that there&#8217;s still
another section behind him,&#8221; explained Andrews.
&#8220;The Confederate commander at Chattanooga
fears the approach of General Mitchell and has
ordered all the rolling stock of the railroad to
be sent south to Atlanta. The new train should
be here in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime the people around the station
had all heard of the danger which threatened
Chattanooga from the Union army. The train-dispatcher
came running over to the engine, and
doffed his cap to Andrews.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t none of my business,&#8221; he said, with
supreme indifference to any rules of grammar,
&#8220;but they say Mitchell is almost at Chattanooga&mdash;and
you&#8217;ll never get through to
Corinth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews assumed an air of contemptuous
superiority.</p>
<p>&#8220;I happen to know more of General Mitchell&#8217;s
movements than you do,&#8221; he said, &#8220;And,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
what&#8217;s more, no Confederate officer takes orders
from a railroad employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean any offense,&#8221; answered the
train-dispatcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go back and see that the switches are
ready for me to move on the instant the next
freight gets here,&#8221; ordered the leader. The
young man walked away, with a nod of assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;He talks proud enough,&#8221; he thought; &#8220;he
must be a relation of Jefferson Davis, from his
airs.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the dispatcher had gone, Andrews whispered
to George: &#8220;We ought to let the boys in
the car know the cause of our detention&mdash;and
warn them that in case of anything going wrong
in our plans they must be prepared to fight for
their lives. Could you manage to get word to
them without attracting suspicion?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy made no verbal answer. But as he
left the cab and vaulted to the ground, his looks
showed that he understood what was wanted,
and proposed to execute the commission. After
sauntering among the men who stood near the
engine, he crossed the track of the siding,
directly in front of &#8220;The General&#8217;s&#8221; headlight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
and soon leaned, in a careless attitude, against
the car in which so many of his companions were
waiting. He was now on the opposite side of
the track from the Kingstonians, but directly
alongside the main track, and in full view from
the station.</p>
<p>George began, in a very low tone, to whistle a
few bars from &#8220;The Blue Bells of Scotland.&#8221; It
was a tune he had often indulged in during his
travels from the Union camp. As he finished
there came a bark of recognition from Waggie,
and a slight stir in the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you there, Watson?&#8221; asked the boy, under
his breath. &#8220;Can you hear me? If you
can, scratch on the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause, and the faint
sound of footsteps was heard within the car.
Then came an answering scratch.</p>
<p>George went on, in the same tone, as he leaned
against the car, and apparently gazed into space:
&#8220;Andrews wants you&mdash;to know&mdash;that we&#8217;re
waiting&mdash;till some freight trains&mdash;get in&mdash;from
Chattanooga. But if anything&mdash;should happen&mdash;before
we&mdash;can get away&mdash;be ready to fight.
Keep Waggie from barking&mdash;if you can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>Another scratching showed that Watson had
heard and understood. But Waggie began to
bark again. George was filled with vexation.
&#8220;Why did I let Waggie go in the car?&#8221; he
asked himself.</p>
<p>Just then a welcome whistle proclaimed that
the third freight train was approaching. It was
time; the delay at Kingston must have occupied
nearly an hour&mdash;it seemed like a whole day&mdash;and
the men about the railroad station were becoming
skeptical. They could not understand
why the mysterious commander of the powder-train
should persist in wanting to go on after
hearing that Mitchell was so near.</p>
<p>When George returned to the engine the new
freight went by on the main track directly in the
wake of the second freight, which had been sent
half a mile down the line, to the southward.
The main track was now clear for Andrews.
But the intrepid leader seemed to be facing fresh
trouble. He was standing on the step of the
cab, addressing the old man who had charge of
the switches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Switch me off to the main track at once,&#8221;
thundered Andrews. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, fool, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
the last local freight is in, and I have a clear
road!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a provokingly obstinate twist about
the switch-tender&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Switch yourself off,&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t
take the responsibility for doing it. You may
be what you say you are, but I haven&#8217;t anything
to prove it. You&#8217;re a fool, anyway, to run right
into the arms of the Yankee general.&#8221;</p>
<p>His fellow-townsmen indulged in a murmur of
approval. The men in the cab saw that another
minute would decide their fate, adversely or
otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I order you to switch me off&mdash;in the name of
the Confederate Government!&#8221; shouted the
leader.</p>
<p>More citizens were running over from the station
to find out the cause of the disturbance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know you, and I won&#8217;t take any orders
from you!&#8221; said the switch-tender, more
doggedly than ever. He walked over to the station,
where he hung up the keys of the switch in
the room of the ticket-seller.</p>
<p>In a twinkling Andrews had followed him, and
was already in the ticket room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry for this,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;for I&#8217;ll
report your rascally conduct to General Beauregard!&#8221;
He seized the keys as he spoke, and
shook them in the old man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>The latter looked puzzled. He had begun to
think that this business of sending powder to
Beauregard was a trick of some kind, yet the
confident bearing of the leader impressed him at
this crisis. Perhaps he had made a mistake in
refusing to obey the orders; but ere he could
decide the knotty problem Andrews took the
keys, hurried from the station, and unlocked the
switch. Then he jumped into the cab, as he
shouted to the men near the engine: &#8220;Tell your
switch-tender that he will hear from General
Beauregard for this!&#8221; He gave a signal, and
the engineer grasped the lever and opened the
steam valve.</p>
<p>&#8220;The General&#8221; slowly left the siding and
turned into the main track. As the train passed
the station, heading towards the north, the
switch-tender was standing on the platform,
with a dazed expression in his eyes. Andrews
tossed the keys to him, as he cried: &#8220;Forgive
me for being in such a hurry, but the Confederacy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
can&#8217;t wait for you!&#8221; Soon Kingston
was left behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep &#8216;The General&#8217; going at forty miles an
hour,&#8221; said the leader. &#8220;We have only the two
trains to meet now&mdash;a passenger and a freight&mdash;which
won&#8217;t give us any trouble. I tell you, we
had a narrow escape at Kingston. More than
once I thought we were all done for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was pretty well scared when that rascal of
a Waggie barked,&#8221; observed George. The train
was now gliding swiftly on past hills and woods
and quiet pasture-lands. After the long delay
the sensation of rapid motion was delightful.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; cried Andrews, with a tinge of
humor. &#8220;You must bring that rogue back with
you into the engine. When he barks in a place
where there&#8217;s supposed to be nothing but powder
the thing doesn&#8217;t seem quite logical. It throws
discredit on an otherwise plausible story. Let
us stop a couple of miles from here, near Adairsville,
do some wire-cutting, release Waggie, and
see how the fellows are getting along in the
baggage car.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the stop was made the men in the car
quickly opened the door and came tumbling to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
the ground. They were glad to stretch their
legs and get a breath of fresh air. Waggie
bounded and frisked with delight when he
espied George.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a time with that dog,&#8221; said Jenks.
&#8220;I had a flask of water with me, and he insisted
on my pouring every bit of it out on the palm of
my hand, and letting him lap it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other occupants of the car were crowding
around Andrews, as they discussed with him the
fortunate escape from Kingston. Watson, who
seemed to be fired with a sudden enthusiasm,
addressed the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when I heard that switch-tender
refuse to put us on the main track I
thought our hour had come. But the coolness
and the presence of mind of our friend Andrews
have saved the day. Let us give him three
cheers! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cheers were given with a will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, comrades,&#8221; said Andrews, modestly.
&#8220;But don&#8217;t waste any time on me; I
only did what any other man would have done
in my place. Let&#8217;s get to work again&mdash;time&#8217;s
precious.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>At a hint from him George clambered up a
telegraph pole, taking with him a piece of cord
by which he afterwards drew up an axe. Then
he cut the wire, while others in the party were
removing three rails from the track in the rear
of the train. The rails were afterwards deposited
in the baggage car occupied by the men,
as were also some wooden cross-ties which were
found near the road-bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this may be a waste of time,&#8221; said
Andrews. &#8220;We shall probably be in Chattanooga
before any one has a chance to chase
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet I have a presentiment that we shall be
chased,&#8221; cried Macgreggor. &#8220;I believe there
will be a hot pursuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>His hearers, including Andrews, laughed,
almost scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait and see,&#8221; returned Macgreggor.
&#8220;A Southerner is as brave, and has as much
brains as a Northerner.&#8221;</p>
<p>We shall see who was right in the matter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE</h3>
</div>

<p>On sped the fugitive train once more, and in a
few minutes it had stopped, with much bumping
and rattle of brakes at the station called Adairsville.
Hardly had the wheels of the faithful old
&#8220;General&#8221; ceased revolving before a whistle was
heard from the northward.</p>
<p>Andrews peered through the cab up the
track. &#8220;It&#8217;s the regular freight,&#8221; he said, and
calling to the station hands who were gaping at
&#8220;Fuller&#8217;s train,&#8221; as they supposed it must be,
he told them the customary story about the
powder designed for General Beauregard. They
believed the leader, who spoke with his old air
of authority, and they quickly shunted his
&#8220;special&#8221; on to the side track. No sooner had
this been accomplished than the freight made
its appearance.</p>
<p>As the engine of the latter passed slowly by
&#8220;The General&#8221; Andrews shouted to the men in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
the cab: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the passenger train that is on
the schedule?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to be right behind us,&#8221; came the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; whispered Andrews. &#8220;Once let
us pass that passenger, and we&#8217;ll have a clear
road to the very end of the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime the freight was moved past
the station and switched on to the siding, directly
behind the &#8220;special,&#8221; there to wait the arrival of
the passenger train.</p>
<p>George began to grow restless, as the minutes
passed and no train appeared. At last, with the
permission of Andrews, he jumped from the cab,
and walked over to the platform, Waggie following
close at his heels. He looked anxiously up
the track, but he could see nothing, hear nothing.</p>
<p>Two young men, one of them a civilian and
the other evidently a soldier who was home on
furlough (to judge by his gray uniform and
right arm in a sling), were promenading up and
down, and smoking clay pipes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; the soldier was saying.
&#8220;They talk about sending powder through to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
General Beauregard, but it&#8217;s an utter impossibility
to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said his friend. &#8220;The thing
looks fishy. If these fellows are really what
they&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; whispered the soldier. He pointed
to George as he spoke. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re beginning
railroading pretty young,&#8221; he added aloud, scrutinizing
the boy as if he would like to read his
inmost thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never too young to begin,&#8221; answered the
boy, carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this powder train of yours, anyway?&#8221;
asked the soldier, in a wheedling
voice which was meant to be plausible and
friendly.</p>
<p>George had heard enough of the conversation
between the two young Southerners to know that
they were more than curious about the supposed
powder train. And now, he thought, they would
try to entrap him into some damaging admission.
He must be on his guard. He put on as stupid a
look as he could assume (which was no easy task
in the case of a boy with such intelligent features),
as he replied stolidly: &#8220;Dunno. I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
nothing to do with it. I&#8217;m only fireman on the
engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know where you&#8217;re going?&#8221; demanded
the soldier, with a gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the tall chap with the beard who has
charge of the train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much powder have you got on board?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you even know your own
name, you little idiot!&#8221; cried the soldier. &#8220;The
boy hasn&#8217;t got good sense,&#8221; he said, turning to
his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were never more mistaken in your life,&#8221;
answered his friend. &#8220;He&#8217;s only playing a
game. I know something about faces&mdash;and this
boy here has lots of sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>George called Waggie, put the animal in his
pocket, and walked to the door of the little station
without taking any notice of this compliment
to his sagacity. Under the circumstances
he should have preferred the deepest insult. He
felt that a long detention at Adairsville would be
dangerous, perhaps fatal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>Opening the door, the boy entered the station.
It comprised a cheerless waiting-room, with a
stove, bench and water-cooler for furniture, and
a little ticket office at one end. The ticket office
was occupied by the station-agent, who was near
the keyboard of the telegraph wire; otherwise
the interior of the building was empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard anything from the passenger yet?&#8221;
asked George, as he walked unconcernedly into
the ticket office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait a second,&#8221; said the man, his right
hand playing on the board; &#8220;I&#8217;m telegraphing
up the line to Calhoun to find out where she is.
The wires aren&#8217;t working to the south, somehow,
but they&#8217;re all right to the north.&#8221;</p>
<p>Click, click, went the instrument. George returned
leisurely to the doorway of the waiting-room.
He was just in time to hear the young
soldier say to his friend: &#8220;If these fellows try to
get away from here, just let &#8217;em go. I&#8217;ll send a
telegram up the road giving warning that they
are coming, and should be stopped as a suspicious
party. If they don&#8217;t find themselves in hot
water by the time they get to Dalton I&#8217;m a
bigger fool than I think I am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>George stood stock still. Here was danger
indeed! He knew that to send a telegram up the
road would be but the work of a minute; it could
go over the wires to the north before the
&#8220;special&#8221; had pulled away from Adairsville.</p>
<p>At this moment the station-agent came out of
his office. &#8220;The passenger is behind time,&#8221; he
said, and he ran quickly across the tracks to
speak to Andrews, who was looking anxiously
out from the cab of &#8220;The General.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s now or never,&#8221; thought George. He
turned back into the deserted waiting-room,
entered the ticket-office, and pulled from the
belt under his inner coat a large revolver&mdash;the
weapon which he carried in case self-defense became
necessary. Taking the barrel of the revolver,
he tried to pry up the telegraphic keyboard
from the table to which it was attached.
But he found this impossible to accomplish; he
could secure no leverage on the instrument. He
was not to be thwarted, however; so changing
his tactics, he took the barrel in his hand and
began to rain heavy blows upon the keys, with
the butt end. In less time than it takes to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
describe the episode, the instrument had been
rendered totally useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said to himself, with the air of a
conqueror, &#8220;it will take time to repair that
damage, or to send a telegram.&#8221; He was about
to leave the office when he discovered a portable
battery under the table. It was an instrument
that could be attached to a wire, in case of
emergency. George hastily picked it up, and
hurried into the waiting-room. It would never
do to leave this battery behind in the office; but
how could he take it away without being caught
in the act? His eyes wandered here and there,
until they rested upon the stove. There was no
fire in it. An inspiration came to him. He
opened the iron door, which was large, and threw
the battery into the stove. Then he closed the
door, and sauntered carelessly out to the platform.
The soldier and his friend were now
standing at some distance from the station, on a
sidewalk in front of a grocery store. They were
engaged in earnest conversation. Over on the
side-track, where &#8220;The General&#8221; stood, the
station-agent was talking to Andrews. George
joined his leader, and sprang into the cab.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;From what I hear,&#8221; said Andrews, &#8220;the
passenger train is so much behind time that if I
make fast time I can get to Calhoun before it
arrives there, and wait on a siding for it to pass us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you move on,&#8221; urged
George, who happened to know how desirable it
was to get away, but dared not drop any hint to
his leader in the presence of the station-agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking a risk,&#8221; said the station-agent.
&#8220;You may strike the train before you reach Calhoun.&#8221;
He was evidently not suspicious, but he
feared an accident.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I meet the train before we reach Calhoun,&#8221;
cried Andrews, striking his fist against
the window-ledge of the cab, &#8220;why then she
must back till she gets a side-track, and then we
will pass her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and looked at his engineer and the
assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready to go, boys?&#8221; he asked.
They quickly nodded assent; they longed to be
off again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go ahead!&#8221; ordered Andrews. &#8220;A
government special must not be detained by any
other train on the road!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The General&#8221; was away once more. George
began to explain to Andrews what he had heard
at the station, and how he had disabled the telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a brick!&#8221; cried the leader, patting
the boy approvingly on the shoulder; &#8220;and you
have saved us from another scrape. But &#8217;tis
better to provide against any repairing of the
telegraph&mdash;and the sooner we cut a wire and
obstruct the track, the better for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it happened that before the train had
gone more than three miles &#8220;The General&#8221; was
stopped, more wires were cut, and several cross-ties
were thrown on the track in the rear. Then
the train dashed on, this time at a terrific speed.
Andrews hoped to reach Calhoun, seven miles
away, before the passenger should arrive there.
It was all that George could do to keep his
balance, particularly when he was called upon to
feed the engine fire with wood from the tender.
Once Waggie, who showed a sudden disposition
to see what was going on around him, and tried
to crawl out from his master&#8217;s pocket, came very
near being hurled out of the engine. Curves and
up grades seemed all alike to &#8220;The General&#8221;;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the noble steed never slackened its pace for an
instant. The engineer was keeping his eyes on
a point way up the line, so that he might slow
up if he saw any sign of the passenger; the
assistant sounded the whistle so incessantly that
George thought his head would split from the
noise. Once, at a road crossing, they whirled by
a farm wagon containing four men. The boy
had a vision of four mouths opened very wide.
In a second wagon and occupants were left far
behind.</p>
<p>In a space of time which seemed incredibly
short Calhoun was reached. Down went the
brakes and &#8220;The General&#8221; slid into the station
to find directly in front, on the same track, the
long-expected passenger train.</p>
<p>&#8220;There she is!&#8221; cried Andrews; &#8220;and not
before it&#8217;s time!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only by the most strenuous efforts
that the engineer could keep &#8220;The General&#8221;
from colliding with the locomotive of the opposing
train. When he brought his obedient iron-horse
to a standstill there was only the distance
of a foot between the cowcatchers of the two
engines. The engineer of the passenger train
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
leaned from his cab and began to indulge in impolite
language. &#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean,&#8221; he shouted,
&#8220;by trying to run me down?&#8221; And he added
some expressions which would not have passed
muster in cultivated society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear the road! Clear the road!&#8221; roared
Andrews. &#8220;This powder train must go through
to General Beauregard at once! We can&#8217;t stay
here a minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>These words acted like a charm. The passenger
train was backed to a siding, and &#8220;The
General&#8221; and its burden were soon running out
of Calhoun.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more trains!&#8221; said Andrews. His voice
was husky; the perspiration was streaming from
his face. &#8220;Now for a little bridge burning.
There&#8217;s a bridge a short distance up the road,
across the Oostenaula River, where we can begin
the real business of the day. But before we get
to it let us stop &#8216;The General&#8217; and see what
condition he is in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has behaved like a gentleman, so far,&#8221;
said the engineer. &#8220;He must be in sympathy
with us Northerners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow up!&#8221; ordered Andrews. &#8220;The old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
fellow is beginning to wheeze a little bit; I can
tell that he needs oiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obedient to the command, the engineer
brought &#8220;The General&#8221; to a halt. As the men
came running from the baggage car, Andrews
ordered them to take up another rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good exercise, boys,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;even
if it may not be actually necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he helped his engineers to inspect
&#8220;The General.&#8221; The engine was still in excellent
condition, although the wood and water
were running a little low. It received a quick
oiling, while George climbed up a telegraph pole
and severed a wire in the manner heretofore
described. Eight of the party were pulling at a
rail, one end of which was loose and the other
still fastened to the cross-ties by spikes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, away to the southward, came the
whistle of an engine. Had a thunderbolt descended
upon the men, the effect could not have
been more startling. The workers at the rail
tore it away from the track, in their wild excitement,
and, losing their balance, fell headlong
down the side of the embankment on which they
had been standing. They were up again the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
next instant, unhurt, but eager to know the
meaning of the whistle.</p>
<p>Was there an engine in pursuit? Andrews
looked down the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>There <i>was</i> something to gaze at. Less than a
mile away a large locomotive, which was reversed
so that the tender came first, was running
rapidly up the line, each instant approaching
nearer and nearer to the fugitives. In the
tender stood men who seemed to be armed with
muskets.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are after us,&#8221; said Andrews. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no doubt about it.&#8221; He was very calm now; he
spoke as if he were discussing the most commonplace
matter in the world.</p>
<p>His companions crowded around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us stand and fight them!&#8221; cried Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; urged Jenks, who had forgotten all
about his sore back; &#8220;we can make a stand
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews shook his head. &#8220;Better go on,
boys,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;We have taken out this
rail, and that will delay them. In the meantime
we can go on to the Oostenaula bridge and burn it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>There was no time for discussion. The men
yielded their usual assent to the orders of their
chief. They quickly scrambled back into the
train, to their respective posts, and Andrews
gave the signal for departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Push the engine for all it&#8217;s worth!&#8221; he commanded;
&#8220;we must make the bridge before the
enemy are on us.&#8221; The engineer set &#8220;The
General&#8221; going at a rattling pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;How on earth could we be pursued, after the
way we cut the wires along the line,&#8221; muttered
the leader. &#8220;Can the enemy have telegraphed
from Big Shanty to Kingston by some circuitous
route? I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you making full speed?&#8221; he asked the
engineer, a second later.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old horse is doing his best,&#8221; answered
the man, &#8220;but the wood is getting precious
low.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;George, pour some engine oil into the furnace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy seized the oil can, and obeyed the
order. The speed of &#8220;The General&#8221; increased;
the engine seemed to spring forward like a horse
to which the spur has been applied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; said Andrews. &#8220;Now if we
can only burn that bridge before the enemy are
up to us, there is still a chance for success&mdash;and
life!&#8221; His voice sank almost to a whisper as he
uttered the last word. With a strange, indescribable
sensation, George suddenly realized
how near they all were to disaster, even to death.
He thought of his father, and then he thought of
Waggie, and wondered what was to become of
the little dog. The boy was cool; he had no
sense of fear; it seemed as if he were figuring in
some curious dream.</p>
<p>Suddenly Andrews left the engine, lurched
into the tender, and began to climb out of it, and
thence to the platform of the first baggage car.
George looked back at him in dread; surely the
leader would be hurled from the flying train and
killed. But he reached the car in safety and
opened the door. He shouted out an order
which George could not hear, so great was the
rattle of the train; then he made his way, with
the ease of a sure-footed chamois, back to &#8220;The
General.&#8221; He had ordered the men in the car
to split up part of its sides for kindling-wood.
By the use of the cross-ties, which they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
picked up along the road, they battered down
some of the planking of the walls, and quickly
reduced it to smaller pieces. It was a thrilling
sight. The men worked as they had never
worked before. It was at the imminent risk of
falling out, however, and as the train swung
along over the track it seemed a miracle that
none of them went flying through the open sides
of the now devastated car.</p>
<p>On rushed &#8220;The General.&#8221; As it turned a
curve George, who was now in the tender,
glanced back to his right and saw&mdash;the pursuing
engine less than a mile behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are after us again!&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;They have gotten past the broken rail somehow,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;They must have track repairing
instruments on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrews set his lips firmly together like a man
who determines to fight to the last.</p>
<p>George made his way back to the cab. &#8220;Will
we have time to burn the bridge?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must wait and see,&#8221; answered the leader,
as he once more left the engine and finally
reached the despoiled baggage car. He said
something to Jenks; then he returned to the cab.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; anxiously asked
the boy. He could hear the shrill whistle of the
pursuing locomotive. &#8220;Com-ing! Com-ing!&#8221;
it seemed to say to his overwrought imagination.</p>
<p>Andrews made no answer to George; instead
he shouted a command to the engineer: &#8220;Reverse
your engine, and move backwards at full
speed!&#8221;</p>
<p>The engineer, without asking any questions,
did as he was told. Jenks ran through to the
second car and contrived, after some delay caused
by the roughness of the motion, to uncouple it
from the third. This last car was now entirely
loose from the train, and would have been left
behind had it not been that the engine had already
begun to go back. Faster and faster
moved &#8220;The General&#8221; to the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go forward again,&#8221; finally ordered Andrews.
The engine slowly came to a standstill, and then
plunged forward once more. Now George could
see the meaning of this man&oelig;uvre. The third
car, being uncoupled, went running back towards
the enemy&#8217;s tender. Andrews hoped to effect a
collision.</p>
<p>But the engineer of the pursuing locomotive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
was evidently ready for such an emergency. He
reversed his engine, and was soon running backwards.
When the baggage car struck the tender
no harm was done; the shock must have been
very slight. In another minute the enemy&#8217;s engine
was puffing onward again in the wake of
the fugitives, while the car was being pushed
along in front of the tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;That didn&#8217;t work very well,&#8221; said Andrews,
placidly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more &#8220;The General&#8221; was reversed.
This time the second car was uncoupled and
sent flying back. &#8220;The General&#8221; was now
hauling only the tender and the one baggage car
in which the majority of the members of the
party were confined. The second attempt, however,
met with no better result than the first:
the enemy pursued the same tactics as before;
reversing the locomotive, and avoiding a serious
collision. It now started anew on the pursuit,
pushing the two unattached cars ahead of it, apparently
little hampered as to speed by the incumbrance.
And now, unfortunately enough,
the bridge was in plain view, only a few hundred
yards ahead. As the enemy turned a new curve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
George caught a view of the tender. A dozen
men, armed with rifles, were standing up in it;
he could see the gleam of the rifle barrels.</p>
<p>&#8220;More oil,&#8221; ordered Andrews. The boy
seized the can, and poured some more of the
greasy liquid into the fiery furnace. He knew
that the wood was almost exhausted, and that it
would soon be impossible to hold the present rate
of progress. Oh, if there only would be time to
burn the bridge, and thus check the pursuers!
But he saw that he was hoping for the impracticable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we stop on the bridge?&#8221; asked the
engineer, in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late,&#8221; answered Andrews. &#8220;Keep
her flying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the bridge went the engine, with the
pursuers only a short distance behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us have some of that kindling-wood for
the furnace,&#8221; shouted Andrews to the men in the
baggage car. The men began to pitch wood
from the door of the car into the tender, and
George transferred some of it to the furnace.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; cried the engineer. &#8220;We
need wood more than we need a kingdom!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Throw out some of those cross-ties,&#8221; thundered
the leader. The men dropped a tie here
and there on the track, so that a temporary
obstruction might be presented to the pursuing
locomotive.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some help,&#8221; said Andrews, as he
craned his neck out of the cab window and
looked back along the line. &#8220;Those ties will
make them stop a while, any way.&#8221; In fact the
enemy had already stopped upon encountering
the first log; two men from the tender were
moving it from the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve a good fighting chance yet,&#8221; cried
Andrews, whose enthusiasm had suddenly returned.
&#8220;If we can burn another bridge, and
block these fellows, the day is ours!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The water in the boiler is almost gone!&#8221; announced
the engineer.</p>
<p>George&#8217;s heart sank. What meant all the
wood in the world without a good supply of
water? But Andrews was equal to the emergency.
&#8220;Can you hold out for another mile or
so?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about that, and no more,&#8221; came the
answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right. We are about to run by Tilton station.
A little beyond that, if I remember rightly,
is a water tank.&#8221; Andrews, in his capacity as
a spy within the Southern lines, knew Georgia
well, and had frequently traveled over this
particular railroad. It was his acquaintance
with the line, indeed, that had enabled him to
get through thus far without failure.</p>
<p>Past Tilton ran &#8220;The General,&#8221; as it nearly
swept two frightened rustics from the platform.
Then the engine began to slow up, until it finally
rested at the water tank.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was right,&#8221; said Andrews. He leaped
from the cab, and gazed down the line. &#8220;The
enemy is not in sight now,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Those
ties are giving them trouble. Put some more on
the track, boys. George, try some more wire-cutting.
Brown, get your boiler filled.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an incredibly short space of time the
telegraph wire had been cut, the engine was
provided with water, and some more ties had
been placed upon the track in the rear. What a
curious scene the party presented; how tired,
and dirty, yet how courageous they all looked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we take up a rail?&#8221; demanded Macgreggor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Scarcely had the words left his lips
before the whistle of the enemy was again
heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;No time,&#8221; shouted the leader. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be
off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Off went the train&mdash;the grimy, panting engine,
the tender, and the one baggage car, which was
now literally torn to pieces in the frantic endeavor
to provide kindling-wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want more wood,&#8221; George shouted back
to the men after they had proceeded a couple of
miles. Some wood was thrown into the tender
from the baggage car, with the gloomy news:
&#8220;This is all we have left!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more wood after this,&#8221; explained George.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Andrews, very cheerfully.
&#8220;Tell them to throw out a few more ties
on the track&mdash;as long as they&#8217;re too big to burn
in our furnace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The order was shouted back to the car. It
was instantly obeyed. There was now another
obstruction for the enemy; but George wondered
how Andrews, full of resources though he might
be, would find more wood for the engine. But
Andrews was equal even to this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried the leader, after they had passed
up the line about a mile from where the ties had
been last thrown out. &#8220;The General&#8221; was soon
motionless, breathing and quivering like some
blooded horse which had been suddenly reined in
during a race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s more work for you, boys,&#8221; cried
Andrews. He was already on the ground, pointing
to the wooden fences which encompassed the
fields on both sides of the track. The men
needed no further prompting. In less than three
minutes a large number of rails were reposing in
the tender. George regarded them with an expression
of professional pride, as befitted the
fireman of the train.</p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble about wood or water now,&#8221; he
said, as &#8220;The General&#8221; tore onward again.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the leader. &#8220;We will beat those
Southerners yet!&#8221; He positively refused to
think of failure at this late stage of the game.
Yet it was a game that did not seem to promise
certain success.</p>
<p>Thus the race continued, with &#8220;The General&#8221;
sometimes rocking and reeling like a drunken
man. On they rushed, past small stations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
swinging around curves with the men in the car
sitting on the floor and clinging to one another
for fear they would be knocked out by the
roughness of the motion. As George thought of
this terrible journey in after years he wondered
why it was that engine, car and passengers were
not hurled headlong from the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are coming to Dalton,&#8221; suddenly announced
Andrews. Dalton was a good-sized
town twenty-two miles above Calhoun, and
formed a junction with the line running to
Cleveland, Tennessee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be careful here,&#8221; said Andrews,
&#8220;for we don&#8217;t know who may be waiting to receive
us. If a telegram was sent via the coast
up to Richmond, and then down to Dalton, our
real character may be known. Brown, be ready
to reverse your engine if I give the signal&mdash;then
we&#8217;ll back out of the town, abandon the train,
and take to the open fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>George wondered if, by doing this, they would
not fall into the hands of their pursuers. But
there was no chance for argument.</p>
<p>The speed of &#8220;The General&#8221; was now slackened,
so that the engine approached the station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
at a rate of not more than fifteen miles an hour.
Andrews saw nothing unusual on the platform;
no soldiers; no preparations for arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and stop at the platform.
The coast&#8217;s clear so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was necessary that a stop should be made at
Dalton for the reason that there were switches
at this point, owing to the junction of the Cleveland
line, and it would be impossible to run by
the station without risking a bad accident. It
was necessary, furthermore, that this stop should
be as brief as possible, for the dilapidated looks
of the broken baggage car and the general appearance
of the party were such as to invite suspicion
upon too close a scrutiny. Then, worse still,
the enemy might arrive at any moment. Andrews
was again equal to the occasion. As the forlorn
train drew up at the station he assumed the air
and bearing of a major-general, told some plausible
story about being on his way with dispatches
for Beauregard, and ordered that the switches
should be immediately changed so that he could
continue on to Chattanooga. Once again did his
confident manner hoodwink the railroad officials.
The switch was changed, and &#8220;The General&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
was quickly steaming out of Dalton. The citizens
on the platform looked after the party as if
they could not quite understand what the whole
thing meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we cut a wire?&#8221; asked George.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the good?&#8221; returned Andrews.
&#8220;The enemy&#8217;s engine will reach Dalton in a
minute or two&mdash;perhaps they are there now&mdash;and
they can telegraph on to Chattanooga by
way of the wires on the Cleveland line. It&#8217;s a
roundabout way, but it will answer their purpose
just as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we dare not keep on to Chattanooga?&#8221;
asked George, in a tone of keen regret. He had
fondly pictured a triumphant run through Chattanooga,
and an ultimate meeting with the
forces of Mitchell somewhere to the westward,
accompanied by the applause of the troops and
many kind words from the General.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; answered the leader. &#8220;We may
yet burn a bridge or two, and then take to the
woods. It would be folly to enter Chattanooga
only to be caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last Andrews saw that he must change his
plans. He had hoped, by burning a bridge, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
head off the pursuing engine before now; his
failure to do this, and the complication caused by
the telegraph line to Cleveland, told him that he
must come to a halt before reaching Chattanooga.
To run into that city would be to jump
deliberately into the lion&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see if there&#8217;s time to break a rail,&#8221;
suddenly said the leader. The train was stopped,
within sight of a small camp of Confederate
troops, and the men started to loosen one of the
rails. But hardly had they begun their work
when there came the hated whistling from the
pursuing engine. The adventurers abandoned
their attempt, leaped to their places in cab and
car, and &#8220;The General&#8221; again sped onward.
There were no cross-ties remaining; this form of
obstruction could no longer be used. It was
now raining hard; all the fates seemed to be
combining against the plucky little band of
Northerners.</p>
<p>Andrews began at last to see that the situation
was growing desperate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still one chance,&#8221; he muttered. He
knew that he would soon pass a bridge, and he
went on to elaborate in his mind an ingenious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
plan by which the structure might be burned
without making delay necessary, or risking a
meeting with the pursuers. He scrambled his
way carefully back to the baggage car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want you to set fire to
this car, and then all of you crawl into the
tender.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a bustle in the car at once, although
no one asked a question. The men made a valiant
effort to ignite what was left of the splintered
walls and roof of the car. But it was hard
work. The rain, combined with the wind produced
by the rapid motion of the train, made it
impossible to set anything on fire even by a very
plentiful use of matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get something better than
matches,&#8221; growled Watson. He had just been
saved from pitching out upon the roadside by the
quick efforts of one of his companions, who had
seized him around the waist in the nick of time.
Andrews went to the forward platform of the
car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you get us a piece of burning wood
over here,&#8221; he called to George.</p>
<p>The lad took a fence rail from the tender,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
placed it in the furnace, until one end was blazing,
and then contrived to hand it to the leader
from the rear of the tender. Andrews seized it,
and applied the firebrand to several places in the
car. But it was no easy task to make a conflagration;
it seemed as if the rail would merely
smoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop the engine,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;The General&#8221;
was brought to a halt, and then, when the
artificial wind had ceased, the rail flared up.
Soon the torn walls and roof of the car burst
into flames.</p>
<p>&#8220;Into the tender, boys,&#8221; cried Andrews. The
men needed no second bidding. The fire was
already burning fiercely enough, despite the rain,
to make their surroundings anything but comfortable.
They scrambled into the tender. The
engineer put his hand to the lever, pulled the
throttle, and the party were again on the wing
although at a slow and constantly lessening rate
of speed. At last they scarcely moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;The General&#8221; was now passing over the
bridge&mdash;a covered structure of wood. Andrews
uncoupled the blazing car, and climbed back into
the tender. The engine again sped on, leaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
the burning car in the middle of the bridge. The
scheme of the leader was apparent; he hoped
that the flames would be communicated to the
roof of the bridge, and so to the entire wood-work,
including the railroad ties and lower
beams.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; thought Andrews. He would have
the satisfaction of destroying one bridge at least&mdash;and
he would put an impassable barrier between
the enemy and himself. His joy was,
however, only too short lived. The Confederates
boldly ran towards the bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t dare to tackle that car,&#8221; said
George, as &#8220;The General&#8221; kept moving onward.
Yet the pursuing engine, instead of
putting on brakes, glided through the bridge,
pushing the burning car in front of it. When it
reached the other side of the stream the car was
switched off on a siding, and the enemy prepared
to sweep onwards. The bridge was saved;
Andrews&#8217; plan had failed. The Northerners gave
groans of disappointment as they fled along in
front.</p>
<p>Finally it was resolved to make a last stop,
and to attempt to pull up a rail. The enemy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
was now some distance behind, having been delayed
by the time necessarily consumed in switching
off the car, so that there seemed a reasonable
chance of executing this piece of strategy.
When the men had again alighted on firm
ground several of them felt actually seasick
from the jolting of the engine and tender. It
was now that one of the party made a novel proposition
to Andrews. The plan seemed to have
a good deal to recommend it, considering how
desperate was the present situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us run the engine on,&#8221; he said, &#8220;until we
are out of sight of the enemy, and are near some
of the bushes which dot the track. Then we can
tear up a rail, or obstruct the track in some way,
and quickly hide ourselves in the bushes. The
engineer will stay in &#8216;The General,&#8217; and, as soon
as the enemy comes in sight, can continue up
the road, just as if we were all on board. When
the Confederates reach the broken rail, and prepare
to fix it, we can all rush out at them and
fire our revolvers. They will be taken by surprise&mdash;we
will have the advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds logical enough,&#8221; observed Andrews;
&#8220;it&#8217;s worth trying, if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>Again the enemy&#8217;s whistle sounded ominously
near. There was no chance to argue about anything
now. The men leaped to their places,
and &#8220;The General&#8221; was quickly gotten under
way.</p>
<p>Watson looked at Jenks, next to whom he was
huddled in the tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is this sort of thing to be kept
up?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;d far rather get out and
fight the fellows than run along this way!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenks brushed the rain from his grimy face
but made no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;This all comes from that fatal delay at Kingston,&#8221;
announced Macgreggor. &#8220;We would be
just an hour ahead if it hadn&#8217;t been for those
wretched freight trains.&#8221;</p>
<p>The enemy&#8217;s engine gave an exultant whistle.
&#8220;Vic-to-ry! Vic-to-ry!&#8221; it seemed to shriek.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ENERGETIC PURSUIT</h3>
</div>

<p>Who were pursuing the Northern adventurers,
and how did they learn the story of the stolen
engine? To answer these questions let us go
back to Big Shanty at the moment when the
train having the conspirators on board reached
that station from Marietta. The conductor,
William Fuller, the engineer, Jefferson Cain,&mdash;and
Anthony Murphy, a railroad official from
Atlanta, were among those who went into the
&#8220;Shanty&#8221; to enjoy breakfast. They were naturally
unsuspicious of any plot; the deserted engine
seemed absolutely secure as it stood within very
sight of an encampment of the Confederate army.</p>
<p>Suddenly Murphy heard something that
sounded like escaping steam. &#8220;Why, some one
is at your engine,&#8221; he cried to Fuller, as he
jumped from his seat. Quick as a flash Fuller
ran to the door of the dining-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one&#8217;s stealing our train!&#8221; he shouted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
&#8220;Come on, Cain!&#8221; The passengers rushed from
their half-tasted meal to the platform. The conductor
began to run up the track, followed by his
two companions, as the train moved rapidly away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jerusha!&#8221; laughed one of the passengers, a
gouty-looking old gentleman; &#8220;do those fellows
expect to beat an engine that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd joined in the fun of the thing, and
wondered what the whole scene could mean.
Perhaps it was but the prank of mischievous
boys who were intent on taking an exciting ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, anyway?&#8221; asked Murphy, as the
three went skimming along on the railroad ties,
and the train drew farther and farther away
from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet some conscripts have deserted from
camp,&#8221; cried Fuller. &#8220;They&#8217;ll run up the line a
mile or two, then leave the engine and escape
into the woods.&#8221; He did not imagine, as yet,
that his train was in the hands of Northern
soldiers.</p>
<p>On, on, went the trio until they reached the
point where George had cut the wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Cain; &#8220;they&#8217;ve cut the
wire! And look at the broken rail!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>One glance was sufficient to show that the engine
thieves, whoever they might be, knew their
business pretty well. There was something
more in this affair than a mere escape of conscripts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look up the road,&#8221; said Murphy. He
pointed to some workmen who had a hand-car
near the track, not far above him. Hurrying on,
the trio soon reached these men, explained to
them what had happened, and impressed them
into the service of pursuit. In two or three
minutes the whole party were flying up the line
on the hand-car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kingston is nearly thirty miles away,&#8221; explained
Fuller, as they bowled along. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know who the fellows are, but they&#8217;ll be blocked
by freight when they get there, and we may
manage to reach them somehow.&#8221; Even if the
unknown enemy got beyond Kingston, he
thought he might yet reach them if he could
only find an engine. The whole escapade was a
puzzle, but the three men were determined to
bring back &#8220;The General.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus they swept anxiously but smoothly on
until&mdash;presto! The whole party suddenly leaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
into the air, and then descended into a ditch,
with the hand-car falling after them. They had
reached the place where the telegraph pole obstructed
the track. They had turned a sharp
curve, and were on it, before they realized the
danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one hurt, boys?&#8221; asked Murphy.</p>
<p>No one was hurt, strange to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with the car,&#8221; cried Fuller. The hand-car
was lifted to the track, beyond the telegraph
pole, and the journey was resumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we find an engine here?&#8221; thought
Fuller, as the car approached Etowah station.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are iron furnaces near here,&#8221; said
Murphy, &#8220;and I know that an engine named
&#8216;The Yonah&#8217; has been built to drag material
from the station to the furnaces. It&#8217;s one of the
finest locomotives in the South.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that hasn&#8217;t been stolen too,&#8221; said
Cain.</p>
<p>Now they were at the station. They knew
that it would be impossible to make the necessary
speed with a hand-car. If they were to
reach the runaways they <i>must</i> obtain an engine,
and quickly at that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By all that&#8217;s lucky,&#8221; shouted Murphy;
&#8220;there&#8217;s &#8216;The Yonah&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>There, right alongside the platform, was the
welcome engine. It was about to start on a
trip to the iron furnaces. The steam was up;
the fire was burning brightly.</p>
<p>Etowah was ablaze with excitement as soon
as the pursuers explained what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have &#8216;The Yonah,&#8217;&#8221; cried Fuller,
&#8220;and I want some armed men to go along with
me!&#8221; No question now about seizing the
engine; no question as to the armed men. With
hardly any delay Fuller was steaming to the
northward with &#8220;The Yonah,&#8221; and the tender
was crowded with plucky Southerners carrying
loaded rifles. The speed of the engine was at
the rate of a mile a minute, and how it did fly,
to be sure. Yet it seemed as if Kingston would
never be reached.</p>
<p>When, at last, they did glide up to the station,
Fuller learned that the alleged Confederate train
bearing powder to General Beauregard had left
but a few minutes before. Great was the amazement
when he announced that the story of the
leader was all a blind, invented to cover up one
of the boldest escapades of the war.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>But now Fuller was obliged to leave the faithful
&#8220;Yonah.&#8221; The blockade of trains at Kingston
was such that it would have required some
time before the engine could get through any
farther on the main track. He seized another
engine, which could quickly be given the right
of way, and rushed forward. Two cars were
attached to the tender; in it were more armed
men, hastily recruited at Kingston. They were
ready for desperate work.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Yonah&#8217; was a better engine than this
one,&#8221; said Murphy, regretfully, before they had
run more than two or three miles. He spoke the
truth; the new engine had not the speed of &#8220;The
Yonah.&#8221; The difference was quite apparent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must do the best we can with her,&#8221; said
Fuller. &#8220;Put a little engine oil into the furnace.
We&#8217;ll give her a gentle stimulant.&#8221;</p>
<p>His order was promptly obeyed, but the locomotive
could not be made to go faster than at
the rate of forty miles an hour. Murphy and
Cain were both at the lever, keeping their eyes
fixed as far up the line as possible, so that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
might stop the train in good time should they
see any obstruction on the track. Thus they
jogged along for some miles until the two men
made a simultaneous exclamation, and reversed
the engine. In front of them, not more than a
hundred yards away, was a large gap in the
track. It marked the place where the Northerners
had taken up the rails south of Adairsville.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jupiter! That was a close shave!&#8221; cried
Murphy. For the train had been halted within
less than five feet of the break. Out jumped the
whole party, Fuller, Cain and Murphy from the
cab, and the armed men from the cars. The
delay, it was supposed, would be only temporary;
there were track-laying instruments in the car;
the rails could soon be reset. But when it was
seen that each of the rails had disappeared (for
our adventurers had carried them off with them)
there was a murmur of disgust and disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not tear up some rails in the rear of
the train, and lay them in the break,&#8221; suggested
one of the Southerners.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will take too long,&#8221; cried Fuller, and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
this statement Murphy readily assented. As it
was, the stolen &#8220;General&#8221; was far enough ahead
of them; too far ahead, indeed. If the pursuers
waited here for such a complicated piece of work
as this tearing up and re-laying of the track,
they might lose the race altogether. The conductor
and Murphy started once more to run up
the road-bed (just as they had footed it earlier in
the morning at Big Shanty), and left the rest of
the party to mend the track.</p>
<p>Were they merely running on in an aimless
way? Not by any means. They had not
gone very far before the freight train which
Andrews had encountered at Adairsville came
groaning down the track. The two men made
violent gesticulations as signals to the engineer,
and the train was slowly stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you meet &#8216;The General&#8217;?&#8221; cried Fuller.</p>
<p>The freight engineer told the story of the impressed
powder-train that was hurrying on to
Beauregard, and of the fine-looking, imperious
Confederate who was in command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that Confederate is a <i>Yankee</i>,&#8221; came
the explanation.</p>
<p>The freight engineer made use of some expressions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
which were rather uncomplimentary to
Andrews. To think that the supposed Confederate,
who had acted as if he owned the whole
State of Georgia, was an enemy&mdash;a spy! Why,
the thought was provoking enough to ruffle the
most placid temper. And the engineer&#8217;s natural
temper was by no means placid.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have your engine to catch these
fellows!&#8221; said Fuller. Naturally there was no
dissent to this command. He quickly backed the
train to Adairsville, where the freight cars were
dropped. Then Fuller, with engine and tender
still reversed (for there was no turn-table available),
hurried northward on the way to Calhoun
station.</p>
<p>&#8220;This engine is a great sight better than the
last one I had,&#8221; said the conductor, in a tone of
exultation, to Bracken, his new engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, &#8216;The Texas&#8217; is the finest engine in the
whole state,&#8221; answered Bracken, with the air of
a proud father speaking of a child.</p>
<p>They were tearing along at a terrific speed
when Bracken suddenly reversed &#8220;The Texas&#8221;
and brought her to a halt with a shock that
would have thrown less experienced men out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
the cab. On the track in front of them were
some of the cross-ties which the fugitives had
thrown out of their car. Fortunately Fuller had
just taken his position on the tender in front and
gave the signal the instant he saw the ties.
As &#8220;The Texas&#8221; stood there, all quivering and
panting, the conductor jumped to the ground and
threw the ties from the track; then he mounted
the tender again, and the engine kept on to the
northward with its smoke-stack and headlight
pointed in the opposite direction. The same
program was repeated later on, where more ties
were encountered.</p>
<p>When &#8220;The Texas&#8221; dashed into Calhoun it
had run a distance of ten miles, including the
time spent in removing cross-ties, in exactly
twelve minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m after the Yankees who&#8217;re in my stolen
engine,&#8221; cried Fuller to the idlers on the platform.
&#8220;I want armed volunteers!&#8221; He wasted
no words; the story was complete as he thus
told it; the effect was magical. Men with rifles
were soon clambering into the tender. As &#8220;The
Texas&#8221; glided away from the platform Fuller
stretched out his sturdy right arm to a boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
standing thereon and pulled him, with a vigorous
jerk, into the cab. The next minute the
engine was gone. The lad was a young telegraph
operator whom the conductor had recognized.
There was no employment for him as
yet, because the wires were cut along the line,
but there might be need for him later.</p>
<p>Fuller was now aglow with hope. He was
brave, energetic and full of expedients, as we
have seen, and he was warming up more and
more as the possibility of overtaking &#8220;The
General&#8221; became the greater. From what he
had learned at Calhoun he knew that the Northerners
were only a short distance ahead. His
promptness seemed about to be crowned with a
glorious reward. He might even make prisoners
of the reckless train-robbers.</p>
<p>And there, not more than a mile in front of
him, was &#8220;The General&#8221;! He saw the engine
and the three baggage cars, and his heart
bounded at the welcome sight. Then he espied
the men working on the track, and saw them,
later, as they rapidly boarded their train. The
Southerners in the tender of &#8220;The Texas&#8221;
cheered, and held firmly to their rifles. At any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
second now might their weapons be needed in a
fight at close quarters.</p>
<p>Of the chase from this point to Dalton we already
know. Before Fuller reached that station
he knew that it would be possible to send a
telegram to Chattanooga, by way of Cleveland,
even if the Northerners should cut the wires on
the main line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said to the young telegraph
operator, &#8220;I want you to send a telegram to
General Leadbetter, commanding general at
Chattanooga, as soon as we get to Dalton. Put
it through both ways if you can, but by the
Cleveland line at any rate.&#8221; The conductor
took a paper from his wallet and wrote a few
words of warning to General Leadbetter, telling
him not to let &#8220;The General&#8221; and its crew get
past Chattanooga. &#8220;My train was captured this
morning at Big Shanty, evidently by Federal
soldiers in disguise,&#8221; he penciled.</p>
<p>On the arrival at Dalton this telegram was
sent, exactly as the shrewd Andrews had
prophesied. Then &#8220;The Texas&#8221; fled away from
Dalton and the chase continued, as we have
seen in the previous chapter, until a point of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
railroad about thirteen miles from Chattanooga
was reached.</p>
<p>In the cab of &#8220;The General&#8221; Andrews was
standing with his head bowed down; his stock
of hopefulness had suddenly vanished. At last
he saw that the expedition, of which he had
cherished such high expectations, was a complete
failure. A few miles in front was Chattanooga,
where capture awaited them, while a mile in the
rear were well-armed men.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing left to do,&#8221; he said
mournfully to George, who was regarding his
chief with anxious interest. &#8220;We must abandon
the engine, scatter, and get back to General
Mitchell&#8217;s lines as best we can, each in his own
way!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the leader put his hand on the engineer&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;Stop the engine,&#8221; he said; &#8220;the
game is up; the dance is over!&#8221;</p>
<p>The engineer knew only too well what Andrews
meant. He obeyed the order, and the
tired &#8220;General,&#8221; which had faithfully carried
the party for about a hundred miles, panted and
palpitated like a dying horse. The great locomotive
was, indeed, in a pitiable condition. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
brass of the journals and boxes was melted by
the heat; the steel tires were actually red-hot,
and the steam issued from all the loosened
joints.</p>
<p>Andrews turned to the men who were huddled
together in the tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man for himself, boys,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;You must scatter and do the best you can to
steal into the Federal lines. I&#8217;ve led you as well
as I could&mdash;but the fates were against us. God
bless you, boys, and may we all meet again!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke the leader&mdash;now a leader no
longer&mdash;threw some papers into the furnace of
the locomotive. In a twinkling they were reduced
to ashes. They were Federal documents.
One of them was a letter from General Mitchell
which, had it been found upon Andrews by the
Confederates, would in itself have proved evidence
enough to convict him as a spy.</p>
<p>The men in the tender jumped to the ground.
So, likewise, did George, the engineer and his
assistant. Andrews remained standing in the
cab. He looked like some sea captain who was
waiting to sink beneath the waves in his deserted
ship. He worked at the lever and touched the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
valve, and then leaped from his post to the roadbed.
The next moment &#8220;The General&#8221; was
moving backwards towards the oncoming
&#8220;Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll give them a little taste of collision!&#8221;
he cried. His companions turned their eyes towards
the departing &#8220;General.&#8221; If the engine
would only run with sufficient force into the
enemy, the latter might&mdash;well, it was hard to
predict what might not happen. Much depended
on the next minute.</p>
<p>There was a whistle from &#8220;The Texas.&#8221;
&#8220;The General&#8221; kept on to the rear, but at a
slow pace. No longer did the staunch machine
respond to the throttle. The fire in the furnace
was burning low; there was little or no steam;
the iron horse was spent and lame.</p>
<p>The adventurers looked on, first expectantly,
then gloomily. They saw that &#8220;The General&#8221;
was incapacitated; they saw, too, that the
enemy reversed their own engine, and ran backwards
until the poor &#8220;General&#8221; came to a complete
standstill. Pursuit was thus delayed, but
by no means checked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no good,&#8221; sighed Andrews. &#8220;Come,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
comrades, while there is still time, and off with
us in different parties. Push to the westward,
and we may come up to Mitchell&#8217;s forces on the
other side of Chattanooga.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon the men were running to the shelter of a
neighboring wood. George seemed glued to the
sight of the departing &#8220;General.&#8221; He felt as if
an old friend was leaving him, and so he was
one of the last to move. As he, too, finally ran
off, Waggie, who had been released from his
master&#8217;s pocket, bounded by his side as if the
whole proceeding were an enjoyable picnic.
When George reached the wood many of the men
were already invisible. He found Watson leaning
against a tree, pale and breathless.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked the boy anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;This rough journey
over this crooked railroad has shaken me up
a bit. I&#8217;ll be all right in a minute. Just wait
and we&#8217;ll go along together. I wouldn&#8217;t like to
see any harm happen to you, youngster, while I
have an arm to protect you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he continued, when he had regained
his breath; &#8220;we can&#8217;t stay here. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
wonder why Mitchell didn&#8217;t push on and capture
Chattanooga. Then we would not have had to
desert the old engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact was that General Mitchell, after
capturing Huntsville on April the 11th, had
moved into the country to the northeastward
until he came within thirty miles of Chattanooga.
At this point he waited, hoping to hear
that Andrews and his companions had destroyed
the railroad communications from Chattanooga.
No such news reached him, however; he feared
that the party had failed, and he was unable to
advance farther, under the circumstances, without
receiving reinforcements. But of all this
Watson was ignorant.</p>
<p>The man and boy stole out of the wet woods,
and thence a short distance to the westward
until they reached the bottom of a steep hill
which was surmounted by some straggling oaks.
They started to walk briskly up the incline, followed
by Waggie. Suddenly they heard a sound
that instinctively sent a chill running up and
down George&#8217;s spine.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Some animal?&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson gave a grim, unpleasant laugh. &#8220;It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
a hound,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Come on; we don&#8217;t
want that sort of gentleman after us. He&#8217;d be a
rougher animal to handle than Waggie.&#8221;</p>
<p>George redoubled his pace. But his steps
began to lag; his brain was in a whirl; he began
to feel as if he was acting a part in some
horrible dream. Nothing about him seemed
real; it was as if his sensations were those of
another person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything wrong?&#8221; asked Watson, as he
saw that the lad was falling behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing; I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; was the plucky
answer. But fatigue and hunger, and exposure
to the rain, had done their work. George tottered,
clutched at the air, and then sank on
the hillside, inert and unconscious. In a moment
Waggie was licking his face, with a pathetic
expression of inquiry in his little brown
eyes, and Watson was bending over him. Again
came the bay from the hound and the distant
cry from a human voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>TWO WEARY WANDERERS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Poor boy,&#8221; muttered Watson. &#8220;He is done
out.&#8221; He saw that George&#8217;s collapse was due to
a fainting spell, which in itself was nothing
dangerous. But when he heard the distant baying
of the dog, and heard, too, the voices of men&mdash;no
doubt some of the armed Southerners from
the pursuing train&mdash;he saw the peril that encompassed
both himself and the boy. Here
they were almost on top of a hill, near the
enemy, and with no means of escape should they
be unfortunate enough to be seen by the Southerners
or tracked by the hound. If George
could be gotten at once to the other side of the
hill he would be screened from view&mdash;otherwise
he and Watson would soon&mdash;&mdash;But the soldier
did not stop to think what might happen.
He jumped quickly to his feet, seized the unconscious
George, and ran with him, as one might
have run with some helpless infant, to the top of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
the hill, and then down on the other side. Waggie
came barking after them; he seemed to ask why
it was that his master had gone to sleep in this
sudden fashion. Watson paused for a few
seconds at the bottom of the hill, and placed his
burden on the wet grass. There was as yet no
sign of returning life. Once more came that uncanny
bay. The man again took George in his
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; he said. He himself
was ready to drop from the fatigue and excitement
of the day, but hope of escape gave him
strength, and he ran on through an open field
until he reached some bottom-land covered by a
few unhealthy-looking pine-trees. Here he
paused, panting almost as hard as the poor vanished
&#8220;General&#8221; had done in the last stages of
its journey. He next deposited his charge on the
sodden earth. They were both still in imminent
danger of pursuit, but for the time being they
were screened from view.</p>
<p>Watson bent tenderly over the boy, whilst
Waggie pulled at his sleeve as he had been accustomed
to do far away at home when he
wanted to wake up his master. George finally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
opened his eyes and looked around him, first
dreamily, then with a startled air.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, my lad,&#8221; whispered Watson
cheerily. &#8220;You only fainted away, just for
variety, but now you are chipper enough again.&#8221;</p>
<p>George stretched his arms, raised himself to a
sitting posture, and then sank back wearily on
the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I go to
sleep?&#8221; He was utterly weary; he cared not if
a whole army of men and dogs was after him;
his one idea was rest&mdash;rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do,&#8221; said Watson firmly. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t stay here.&#8221; He produced from his pocket
a little flask, poured some of the contents down
the boy&#8217;s throat, and then took a liberal drink
himself. George began to revive, as he asked
how he had been brought to his present resting-place.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my arms,&#8221; exclaimed Watson. &#8220;But I
can&#8217;t keep that sort of thing up forever. We
must get away from here. Every moment is
precious.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if to emphasize the truth of this warning,
the baying of the dog and the cries of men began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
to sound nearer. Watson sprang to his feet.
The increase of the danger gave him new nerve;
he no longer looked the tired, haggard man of
five minutes ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; he said, calmly but impressively;
&#8220;it would be certain capture!&#8221;</p>
<p>George was up in an instant. The draught
from the flask had invested him with new vigor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall we go?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m all
right again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the river,&#8221; answered Watson. He pointed
eagerly to the right of the pines, where they
could see, in the darkening light of the afternoon,
a swollen stream rushing madly past. It
might originally have been a small river, but
now, owing to the spring rains and freshets, it
looked turbulent and dangerous. It was difficult
to cross, yet for that very reason it would make
a barrier between pursued and pursuers. Should
the former try the experiment?</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you swim?&#8221; asked Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll risk it. After all, the water&#8217;s
safer for us than the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out through the pines they ran until they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
were at the water&#8217;s edge. The sight was not
encouraging. The river foamed like an angry
ocean, and a strong current was sweeping down
to the northward.</p>
<p>The soldier looked at the boy in kindly
anxiety. &#8220;The water is a little treacherous,
George,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you think you&#8217;re strong
enough to venture across?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am!&#8221; answered George, proudly.
He felt more like himself now; he even betrayed
a mild indignation at the doubts of his
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Watson, &#8220;we had&mdash;but listen!
By Jove, those rascals have discovered us!
They&#8217;re making this way!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true; the barking of the dog and the
sound of many voices came nearer and nearer.
Waggie began to growl fiercely, quite as if he
were large enough to try a bout with a whole
Confederate regiment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take off your shoes, George,&#8221; cried Watson.
&#8220;Your coat and vest, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both the fugitives divested themselves of boots,
coats and vests; their hats they had already lost
in their flight from &#8220;The General.&#8221; In their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
trousers pockets they stuffed their watches and
some Confederate money.</p>
<p>A sudden thought crossed George&#8217;s mind. It
was a painful thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to become of Waggie?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave him here.&#8221; He would as soon
have left a dear relative stranded on the bank of
the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to leave him,&#8221; said
Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; replied George. There was a
second&#8217;s pause&mdash;but it seemed like the suspense
of an hour. Then the lad had a lucky inspiration.
He leaned down and drew from a side
pocket of his discarded coat a roll of strong cord
which had been used when he climbed the telegraph
poles. Pulling a knife from a pocket in
his trousers he cut a piece of the cord about two
yards in length, tied one end around his waist
and attached the other end to Waggie&#8217;s collar.
The next instant he had plunged into the icy
water, dragging the dog in after him. Watson
followed, and struck out into the torrent with
the vigor of an athlete.</p>
<p>George found at once that his work meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
something more than keeping himself afloat.
The current was rapid, and it required all his
power to keep from being carried down the river
like a helpless log. Waggie was sputtering and
pawing the water in his master&#8217;s wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep going,&#8221; shouted Watson. &#8220;This current&#8217;s
no joke!&#8221; Even he was having no child&#8217;s
play.</p>
<p>Just then George had his mouth full of water;
he could only go on battling manfully. But he
began to feel a great weakness. Was he about
to faint again? He dared not think of it.
There was a loosening of the cord around his
waist. He looked to his left and there was
Waggie floating down the stream like a tiny piece
of wood. His head had slipped from his collar.</p>
<p>Watson tried to grab the dog as he floated by,
but it was too late. He might as well have tried
to change the tide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, George, go on!&#8221; he urged, breathlessly.
The boy struggled onward, but he had
already overtaxed his strength. He became
dizzy; his arms and legs refused to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; sputtered his companion,
who was now alongside of him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go on; don&#8217;t mind me,&#8221; said George, in a
choking voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your hand on my belt,&#8221; sternly commanded
Watson. The young swimmer obeyed,
scarcely knowing what he did. Watson kept on
like a giant fish, sometimes in danger of being
swept away, and sometimes drawing a few feet
nearer to the opposite bank.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The next thing that George knew was when
he found himself lying on the river&#8217;s edge. Watson
was peering at him anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; open your eyes,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We had a narrow escape, but we&#8217;re over the
river at last. I just got you over in time, for
when we neared shore you let go of me, and I
had to pull you in by the hair of your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I ever thank you,&#8221; said George,
feebly but gratefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;By not trying,&#8221; answered Watson. &#8220;Come,
there&#8217;s not a second to lose. Don&#8217;t you hear
our enemies?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubt as to the answer to that
question. Across the river sounded the baying
and the harsh human voices. Almost before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
George realized what had happened Watson had
pulled him a dozen yards away to a spot behind
a large boulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep on your back!&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;The
men are on the other bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>None too soon had he executed this man&oelig;uvre.
He and George could hear, above the noise of
the rushing stream, the tones of their pursuers.
They had just reached the river, and must be
searching for the two Northerners. More than
once the hound gave a loud whine, as if he were
baffled or disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t be here,&#8221; came a voice from across
the river. &#8220;We had better go back; they may
be down the railroad track.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they swam across the stream,&#8221; urged
some one else.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be certain death!&#8221; answered the
first voice.</p>
<p>There was a whining from the dog, as if he
had discovered a scent. Then a simultaneous
cry from several sturdy lungs. &#8220;Look at these
coats and boots!&#8221; &#8220;They did try to cross, after
all.&#8221; &#8220;Well, they never got over in this current!&#8221;
&#8220;They must have been carried down
the Chickamauga and been drowned!&#8221; Such
were the exclamations which were wafted to the
ears of the two fugitives behind the rock.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The Chickamauga,&#8221; said Watson, under his
breath. &#8220;So that&#8217;s the name of the river, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was evidently some heated discussion
going on among the unseen pursuers. At length
one of them cried: &#8220;Well, comrades, as there&#8217;s
not one of us who wants to swim over the river
in its present state, and as the fools may even be
drowned by this time, I move we go home. The
whole countryside will be on the lookout for the
rest of the engine thieves by to-morrow&mdash;and
they won&#8217;t escape us before then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; interrupted a voice, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
know night&#8217;s just the time which they will take
for escape?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready, then, to swim across the
Chickamauga?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go home, and don&#8217;t talk nonsense! To-morrow,
when the river is less angry, we will be
up by dawn&mdash;and then for a good hunt!&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently the advice of the last speaker was
considered wise, for the men left the river bank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
At last their voices could be no longer heard in
the distance. The shades of twilight began to
fall, and the rain ceased. Then Watson and his
companion crawled cautiously from behind the
boulder. They were two as dilapidated creatures
as ever drew breath under a southern sky.
With soaking shirts and trousers, and without
coats, vests, or shoes, they looked the picture
of destitution. And their feelings! They were
hungry, dispirited, exhausted. All the pleasure
seemed to have gone out of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay in this charming spot all
night,&#8221; said Watson, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose a rock is as good as anything else
we can find,&#8221; answered the boy gloomily.
&#8220;Poor Waggie! Why did I try to drag him
across the river?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little midget,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never forget the appealing look in his eyes as he
went sailing past me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear that?&#8221; cried George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear what? Some one after us again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s a dog barking!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it sounds like Waggie, but it can&#8217;t be
he. He&#8217;s gone to another world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, he hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered George. He forgot
his weakness, and started to run down the
bank, in the direction whence the sound proceeded.
Watson remained behind; he could not
believe that it was the dog.</p>
<p>In the course of several minutes George came
running back. He was holding in his hands a
little animal that resembled a drowned rat. It
was Waggie&mdash;very wet, very bedraggled, but
still alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that isn&#8217;t a miracle!&#8221; cried Watson.
He stroked the dripping back of the rescued dog,
whereupon Waggie looked up at him with a
grateful gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found him just below here, lying on a bit
of rock out in the water a few feet away from
the bank,&#8221; enthusiastically explained George.
&#8220;He must have been hurled there, by the
current.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Waggie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we make three wet
looking tramps, don&#8217;t we? And I guess you are
just as hungry as the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waggie wagged his tail with great violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of a warm, comfortable bed,&#8221; observed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
the boy, with a sort of grim humor; &#8220;and a
nice supper beforehand of meat&mdash;and eggs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And hot coffee&mdash;and biscuits&mdash;and a pipe of
tobacco for me, after the supper,&#8221; went on Watson.
He turned from the river and peered into
the rapidly increasing gloom. About a mile inland,
almost directly in front of him, there shone
a cheerful light.</p>
<p>George, who also saw the gleam, rubbed his
hands across his empty stomach, in a comical
fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be supper there,&#8221; he said, pointing
to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t dare eat it,&#8221; replied his friend.
&#8220;The people within fifty miles of here will be on
the lookout for any of Andrews&#8217; party&mdash;and
the mere appearance of us will be enough to
arouse suspicion&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson hesitated; he was in a quandary. He
was not a bit frightened, but he felt that the
chances of escape for George and himself were
at the ratio of one to a thousand. He knew
actually nothing of the geography of the surrounding
country, and he felt that as soon as
morning arrived the neighborhood would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
searched far and wide. Had he been alone he
might have tried to walk throughout the night
until he had placed fifteen or twenty miles between
himself and his pursuers. But when he
thought of George&#8217;s condition he realized that it
would be a physical impossibility to drag the
tired lad very far.</p>
<p>Finally Watson started away towards the distant
light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay here till I get back,&#8221; he said to George;
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to explore.&#8221;</p>
<p>In less than an hour he had returned to the
river&#8217;s bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in luck,&#8221; he said joyously. &#8220;I stole
across to where that light is, and found it came
from a little stone house. I crept into the
garden on my hands and knees&mdash;there was no
dog there, thank heaven&mdash;and managed to get a
glimpse into the parlor through a half-closed
blind. There sat a sweet-faced, white-haired old
gentleman, evidently a minister of the gospel,
reading a chapter from the scriptures to an
elderly lady and two girls&mdash;his wife and children
I suppose. He can&#8217;t have heard anything
about our business yet&mdash;for I heard him ask one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
of the girls, after he stopped reading, what all
the blowing of locomotive whistles meant this
afternoon&mdash;and she didn&#8217;t know. So we can
drop in on them to-night, ask for supper and a
bed, and be off at daybreak to-morrow before
the old fellow has gotten wind of anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon they were off, Watson, George and
Waggie, and covered the fields leading to the
house in unusually quick time for such tired
wanderers. When they reached the gate of
the little garden in front of the place George
asked: &#8220;What story are we to tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual yarn, I suppose,&#8221; answered Watson.
&#8220;Fleming County, Kentucky&mdash;anxious to
join the Confederate forces&mdash;<i>et cetera</i>. Bah!
I loathe all this subterfuge and deceit. I wish I
were back fighting the enemy in the open
day!&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked boldly up to the door of the
house and knocked. The old gentleman whom
Watson had seen soon stood before them. The
lamp which he held above him shone upon a face
full of benignity and peacefulness. His features
were handsome; his eyes twinkled genially, as if
he loved all his fellow-men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Watson told his Kentucky story, and asked
food and lodgings for George and himself until
the early morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said the old man, simply but
cordially, &#8220;any friend of the South is a friend of
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister (for he proved to be a country
preacher who rode from church to church &#8220;on
circuit&#8221;), ushered the two Northerners and the
dog into his cozy sitting-room and introduced
them to his wife and two daughters. The wife
seemed as kindly as her husband; the daughters
were pretty girls just growing into womanhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, children,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;get these
poor fellows some supper. They&#8217;re on a journey
to Atlanta, all the way from Kentucky, to enlist.
And I&#8217;ll see if I can&#8217;t rake you up a couple of
coats and some old shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He disappeared up-stairs, and soon returned
with two half-worn coats and two pairs of old
shoes, which he insisted upon presenting to the
fugitives.</p>
<p>&#8220;They belong to my son, who has gone to the
war,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but he&#8217;d be glad to have such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
patriots as you use them. How did you both get
so bare of clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to swim across a stream, and leave
some of our things behind,&#8221; explained Watson.
He spoke but the simple truth. He was glad
that he did, for he hated to deceive a man who
stood gazing upon him with such gentle, unsuspecting
eyes.</p>
<p>It was not long before Watson and George
had gone into the kitchen, where they found a
table laden with a profusion of plain but welcome
food. Waggie, who had been given some
milk, was lying fast asleep by the hearth.</p>
<p>George looked about him, when he had finished
his supper, and asked himself why he could not
have a week of such quiet, peaceful life as this?
Yet he knew that he was, figuratively, on the
brink of a precipice. At any moment he might
be shown in his true light. But how much better
he felt since he had eaten. He was comfortable
and drowsy. The minister and his family,
who had been bustling around attending to the
wants of their guests, began to grow dim in his
weary eyes. Watson, who was sitting opposite
to him, looked blurred, indistinct. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
vaguely conscious that the old gentleman was
saying: &#8220;These are times that try our souls.&#8221;
Then the boy sank back in his chair, sound
asleep. He began to dream. He was on the
cowcatcher of an engine. Andrews was tearing
along in front on a horse, beckoning to him to
come on. The engine sped on faster and faster,
but it could not catch up to the horseman. At
last Andrews and the horse faded away altogether;
and the boy was swimming across the
Chickamauga River. He heard a great shout
from the opposite bank&mdash;and awoke.</p>
<p>Watson had risen from the table; the pipe of
tobacco which the minister had given him as
a sort of dessert was lying broken on the
hearth. There was a despairing look on his face.
It was the look that one might expect to see in a
hunted animal at bay. Near him stood the old
man, who seemed to be the incarnation of mournful
perplexity, his wife, who was no less disturbed,
and the two daughters. One of the
latter, a girl with dark hair and snapping black
eyes, was regarding Watson with an expression
of anger. On the table was an opened
letter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am in your power,&#8221; Watson was saying to
the minister.</p>
<p>What had been happening during the half
hour which George had devoted to a nap?</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor, dear boy, he&#8217;s dropped off to sleep,&#8221;
murmured the minister&#8217;s wife, when she saw
George sink back in his chair. She went into
the sitting-room and returned with a cushion
which she proceeded to place under his head.
&#8220;He is much too young to go to the war,&#8221; she
said, turning towards Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no keeping him from going
South,&#8221; answered his companion. &#8220;He would
go.&#8221; Which was quite true.</p>
<p>The minister handed a pipe filled with Virginia
tobacco to Watson, and lighted one for
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my only vice,&#8221; he laughed pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can well believe you,&#8221; rejoined the Northerner,
as he gratefully glanced at the spiritual
countenance of his host. &#8220;Why should this old
gentleman and I be enemies?&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I
wish the war was over, and that North and South
were once more firm friends.&#8221; He proceeded to
light his pipe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>They began to talk agreeably, and the minister
told several quaint stories of plantation life,
while they smoked on, and the women cleared
off the food from the table.</p>
<p>At last there came a knocking at the front
door. The host left the kitchen, went into the
hallway, and opened the door. He had a brief
parley with some one; then the door closed, and
he reentered the room. Watson thought he
could distinguish the sound of a horse&#8217;s hoofs as
an unseen person rode away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s coming to see you this kind of
night?&#8221; asked the wife. It was a natural question.
It had once more begun to rain; there
were flashes of lightning and occasional rumbles
of thunder.</p>
<p>&#8220;A note of some kind from Farmer Jason,&#8221;
explained the clergyman. &#8220;I hope his daughter
is not sick again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the horse has the colic,&#8221; suggested
one of the girls, who had gentle blue eyes like
her father&#8217;s, &#8220;and he wants some of your
&#8216;Equine Pills.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who brought the letter?&#8221; enquired the wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jason&#8217;s hired man&mdash;he said he hadn&#8217;t time to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
wait&mdash;had to be off with another letter to Farmer
Lovejoy&mdash;said this letter would explain everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you open it, pa, instead of
standing there looking at the outside; you act
as if you were afraid of it,&#8221; spoke up the dark-eyed
girl, who was evidently a damsel of some
spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you may read it yourself, Cynthia,&#8221;
said her father, quite meekly, as if he had committed
some grave offense. He handed the
envelope to the dark-eyed girl. She tore it
open, and glanced over the single sheet of paper
inside. Then she gave a sharp cry of surprise,
and darted a quick, penetrating glance at Watson.
He felt uneasy, although he could not explain
why he did.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked the minister.
&#8220;Anything wrong at the Jasons&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything wrong at the Jasons&#8217;,&#8221; Miss Cynthia
repeated, contemptuously. &#8220;No; there&#8217;s
something wrong, but it isn&#8217;t over at Jasons&#8217;.
Listen to this!&#8221; She held out the paper at
arm&#8217;s length, as if she feared it, and read these
lines:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Pastor Buckley</span>,</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Sir:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is to notify you as how I just have
had news that a party of Yankee spies is at
large, right in our neighborhood. They stole a
train to-day at Big Shanty, but they were obleeged
to jump off only a few miles from here.
So you must keep on the lookout&mdash;they are
around&mdash;leastwise a boy and grown man have
been seen, although most of the others seem to
have gotten away. One of my sons&mdash;Esau&mdash;caught
sight of this man and boy on the edge
of the river late this afternoon. He says the
boy had a dog.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:5em;'>&#8220;Yours,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Charles Jason</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>After Miss Cynthia finished the reading of
this letter there was a silence in the room almost
tragic in its intensity. Watson sprang to his
feet, as he threw his pipe on the hearth. Waggie
woke up with a whine. The Reverend Mr.
Buckley looked at Watson, and then at the
sleeping boy in a dazed way&mdash;not angrily, but
simply like one who is grievously disappointed.
So, too, did Mrs. Buckley and her blue-eyed
daughter.</p>
<p>Finally Miss Cynthia broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are Northern spies, are you?&#8221; she
hissed. &#8220;And you come here telling us a story
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
about your being so fond of the South that you
must travel all the way from Kentucky to fight
for her.&#8221; She threw the letter on the supper-table,
while her eyes flashed.</p>
<p>Watson saw that the time of concealment
had passed. His identity was apparent; he was
in the very centre of the enemy&#8217;s country; his life
hung in the balance. He could not even defend
himself save by his hands, for the pistol which
he carried in his hip-pocket had been rendered
temporarily useless by his passage across the
river. Even if he had possessed a whole brace
of pistols, he would not have harmed one hair of
this kindly minister&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> a Northerner,&#8221; said Watson, &#8220;and I <i>am</i>
one of the men who stole a train at Big Shanty
this morning. We got within a few miles of
Chattanooga, and then had to abandon our
engine, because we were trapped. We tried to
burn bridges, but we failed. We did no more
than any Southerners would have done in the
North under the same circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was at this point that George awoke. He
saw at once that something was wrong but he
prudently held his tongue, and listened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are a spy,&#8221; reiterated Miss Cynthia,
&#8220;and you know what the punishment for that
must be&mdash;North or South!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I know the punishment,&#8221; said
Watson, with deliberation. &#8220;A scaffold&mdash;and a
piece of rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister shuddered. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t hang
the boy, would they?&#8221; asked his wife anxiously.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckley was about to answer, when Miss
Cynthia suddenly cried, &#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her sharp ears had detected some noise outside
the house. She left the room, ran to the
front door, and was back again in a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the neighbors are out with dogs
and lanterns, looking, I&#8217;m sure, for the spies,&#8221; she
announced excitedly, &#8220;and they are coming up
the lane!&#8221;</p>
<p>The first impulse of Watson was to seize
George, and run from the house. But he
realized, the next instant, how useless this would
be; he could even picture the boy being shot
down by an overwhelming force of pursuers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are coming this way,&#8221; said Mr. Buckley,
almost mournfully, as the sound of voices
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
could now be plainly heard from the cozy
kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in your hands,&#8221; said Watson, calmly.
He turned to the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are fighting against my country, which
I love more dearly than life itself,&#8221; answered
Mr. Buckley. &#8220;I can have no sympathy for
you!&#8221; His face was very white; there was a
troubled look in his kindly eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will be hung, father!&#8221; cried the
blue-eyed daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of you, Rachel,&#8221; said Miss
Cynthia. Mrs. Buckley said nothing. She
seemed to be struggling with a hundred conflicting
emotions. Waggie ran to her, as if he considered
her a friend, and put his forepaws on her
dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to give us up?&#8221; asked
Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a loyal Southerner,&#8221; returned the
minister, very slowly, &#8220;and I know what my
duty is. Why should I shield you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson turned to George.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was bound to come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
might as well be to-night as to-morrow, or the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
next day.&#8221; The pursuers were almost at the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said George, pluckily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Miss Cynthia, &#8220;the men are at
the door! Shall I let them in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Buckley turned away her head, for there
were tears in her eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>IN GREATEST PERIL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; commanded the minister. There
was a new look, one of decision, upon his face.
&#8220;Heaven forgive me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I am not doing
right&mdash;but I cannot send a man to the gallows!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a step towards the door leading to
the entry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word, Cynthia,&#8221; he ordered. He
opened a large closet, filled with groceries and
preserving jars, quickly pushed George and Watson
into it, and closed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Rachel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let the men in.&#8221;
The girl departed. Within the space of a minute
nearly a dozen neighbors, all of them carrying
muskets, trooped into the kitchen. They
were sturdy planters, and they looked wet and
out of humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dominie,&#8221; exclaimed one of them,
walking up to the fire and warming his hands,
&#8220;you can thank your stars you&#8217;re not out a mean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
night like this. Have you heard about the big
engine steal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend Jason has written me about it,&#8221; replied
Mr. Buckley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it was the most daring thing I ever
heard tell on,&#8221; cried another of the party. &#8220;A
lot of Yankees actually seized Fuller&#8217;s train when
he was eating his breakfast at Big Shanty, and
ran it almost to Chattanooga. They had pluck,
that&#8217;s certain!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not here to praise their pluck,&#8221; interrupted
another man. &#8220;We are here to find out
if any of &#8217;em have been seen around your place.
We&#8217;ve been scouring the country for two hours,
but there&#8217;s no trace of any of &#8217;em so far&mdash;not
even of the man with the boy and the dog, as
Jason&#8217;s son said he saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Jason&#8217;s son tackle the fellows?&#8221;
asked a voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh,&#8221; said the man at the fireplace; &#8220;Jason&#8217;s
son ain&#8217;t no &#8217;count. All he&#8217;s fit for is to
dance with the girls. It&#8217;s well our army doesn&#8217;t
depend on such milksops as him. He would run
away from a mosquito&mdash;and cry about it afterwards!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen any one suspicious about
here, have you, parson?&#8221; asked a farmer.</p>
<p>The minister hesitated. He had never told a
deliberate falsehood in his life. Was he to begin
now?</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen no suspicious characters?&#8221; echoed the
man at the fireplace. &#8220;No boy with a dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tongue of the good clergyman seemed to
cleave to the roof of his mouth. He could see
the eagle glance of Miss Cynthia fixed upon him.
Just then Waggie, who had been sniffing at the
closet door, returned to the fireplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, since when have you started to keep
dogs, parson?&#8221; asked the last speaker.</p>
<p>The minister had an inspiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;That dog walked in here this evening,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I believe him to be the dog of the boy
you speak of.&#8221; He spoke truth, but he had
evaded answering the leading question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great George!&#8221; cried the man at the fireplace.
&#8220;Then some of the spies are in the neighborhood
yet!&#8221; There were shouts of assent
from his companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did the dog stray in?&#8221; was asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than an hour ago,&#8221; said Mr. Buckley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s try another hunt!&#8221; called out a
young planter. The men were out of the house
the next minute, separating into groups of two
and three to scour the countryside. The lights
of their lanterns, which had shone out in the
rain like will-o&#8217;-the-wisps, grew dimmer and dimmer,
and finally disappeared.</p>
<p>As the front door closed the minister sat down
near the table, and buried his face in his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I did wrong,&#8221; he said, almost to
himself. &#8220;But I could not take a life&mdash;and that
is what it would have been if I had given them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa, you&#8217;re too soft-hearted for this world,&#8221;
snapped Miss Cynthia.</p>
<p>Mrs. Buckley looked at her daughter reprovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father is a minister of the gospel,&#8221; she
said solemnly, &#8220;and he has shown that he can do
good even to his enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Buckley arose, and listened to the sound
of the retreating neighbors. Then he opened the
door of the closet. Watson and George jumped
out joyfully, half smothered though they were,
and began to overwhelm the old man with
thanks for their deliverance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>He drew himself up, however, and refused
their proffered hand shakes. There was a stern
look on his usually gentle face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may have saved your necks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because
I would sacrifice no human life voluntarily,
but I do not forget that you are enemies who
have entered the South to do us all the harm you
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Watson, &#8220;it&#8217;s a mere difference
of opinion. I don&#8217;t care what happens, George
and I will never be anything else than your best
friends!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; cried George; &#8220;you can&#8217;t call
us enemies!&#8221;</p>
<p>The manner of the minister softened visibly;
even Miss Cynthia looked less aggressive than
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t discuss politics,&#8221; answered
Mr. Buckley. &#8220;You have as much right to your
opinions as I have to mine. But I think I have
done all I could be expected to do for you.
Here, take this key, which unlocks the door of
my barn, and crawl up into the hayloft where
you can spend the night. If you are there, however,
when I come to feed the horse, at seven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning, I will not consider it
necessary to keep silent to my neighbors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never fear,&#8221; said Watson, in genial tones;
&#8220;we&#8217;ll be away by daylight. Good-bye, and
God bless you. You have done something to-night
that will earn our everlasting gratitude,
little as that means. Some day this wretched
war will be over&mdash;and then I hope to have the
honor of shaking you by the hand, and calling
you my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson and George were soon safely ensconced
for the night in the minister&#8217;s hayloft, with
Waggie slumbering peacefully on top of a mound
of straw.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are more comfortable than our
pursuers who are running around the country,&#8221;
said George. He was stretched out next to
Watson on the hay, and over him was an old
horse-blanket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to dear old Buckley,&#8221; answered Watson.
&#8220;He is a real Southerner&mdash;generous and
kind of heart. Ah, George, it&#8217;s a shame that the
Americans of one section can&#8217;t be friends with
the Americans of the other section.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they went to sleep, and passed as dreamless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
and refreshing a night as if there were no dangers
for the morrow. At the break of day they
were up again, and out of the barn, after leaving
the key in the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like a general who has no plan of campaign
whatever,&#8221; observed Watson, as he gazed
at the minister&#8217;s residence, in the uncanny morning
light, and saw that no one had as yet
arisen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the campaign will have to develop
itself,&#8221; answered George. The night&#8217;s rest, and
the good supper before it, had made a new boy
of him. Twelve hours previously he had been
exhausted; now he felt in the mood to undergo
anything.</p>
<p>The two walked out of the garden, accompanied
by Waggie, and so on until they reached
an open field. Here they sat down, on the limb
of a dead and stricken tree, and discussed what
they were to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know,&#8221; mused Watson, &#8220;whether
any of our party have been caught or not. But
one thing is as certain as sunrise. Just as soon
as the morning is well advanced the pursuers
will begin their work again, and they will have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
all the advantage&mdash;you and I all the disadvantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The men will be on horseback, too,&#8221; added
George, &#8220;while we will be on foot. We must
remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jove,&#8221; cried Watson, giving his knee a
vigorous slap. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with it,&#8221; said George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; went on his friend. &#8220;Here is the
situation. If we try to push to the westward, to
join Mitchell&#8217;s forces, in broad daylight, or even
at night, we are pretty sure to be captured if
we try to palm ourselves off as Kentucky Southerners.
If we hide in the woods, and keep away
from people, we will simply starve to death&mdash;and
that won&#8217;t be much of an improvement.
That Kentucky story won&#8217;t work now; it has
been used too much as it is. Therefore, if we
are to escape arrest, we must change our characters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Change our characters?&#8221; repeated George,
in wonderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Suppose that we boldly move
through the country as two professional beggars,
and thus gradually edge our way to the westward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
without appearing to do so. You can sing
negro songs, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and other songs, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. And Waggie has some tricks,
hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can play dead dog&mdash;and say his prayers&mdash;and
howl when I sing&mdash;and do some other
tricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ve got the whole scheme in my
mind,&#8221; said Watson, with enthusiasm. &#8220;Let me
play a blind man, with you as my leader. I
think I can fix my eyes in the right way. We
can go from farm to farm, from house to house,
begging a meal, and you can sing, and put the
dog through his tricks. People are not apt to
ask the previous history of beggars&mdash;nor do I
think any one will be likely to connect us with
the train-robbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>George clapped his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; he said. There was a novelty
about the proposed plan that strongly appealed
to his spirit of adventure.</p>
<p>Watson&#8217;s face suddenly clouded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;the combination
of a man, a boy and a dog will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
rather suspicious, even under our new disguise.
Remember Farmer Jason&#8217;s letter last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; retorted George, who
had fallen in love with the beggar scheme, &#8220;but
if we get away from this particular neighborhood
the people won&#8217;t have heard anything about
a dog or a boy. They will only know that some
Northern spies are at large&mdash;and they won&#8217;t be
suspicious of a blind man and his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Watson, after a
little thought. &#8220;Let us get away from here,
before it grows lighter, and put the neighbors
behind us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man and boy, and the telltale dog, jumped
to their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Mr. Buckley,&#8221; murmured Watson,
as he took a last look at the minister&#8217;s house,
&#8220;and heaven bless you for one of the best men
that ever lived!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were hurrying on the next moment, nor
did they stop until they had put six or seven
miles between themselves and the Buckley home.
The sun, directly away from which they had
been moving, was now shining brightly in the
heavens, as it looked down benevolently upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the well-soaked earth. They had now reached a
plantation of some two hundred acres or more, in
the centre of which was a low, long brick house
with a white portico in front. They quickly
passed from the roadway into the place, and
moved up an avenue of magnolia trees. When
they reached the portico a lazy looking negro
came shuffling out of the front door. He gazed,
in a supercilious fashion, at the two whites and
the dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217; foah you fellows gwine come heh
foah?&#8221; he demanded, in a rich, pleasant voice,
but with an unwelcome scowl upon his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just want a little breakfast,&#8221; answered
Watson. He was holding the boy&#8217;s arm, and
looked the picture of a blind mendicant.</p>
<p>The darky gave them a scornful glance. &#8220;Git
away from heh, yoh white trash,&#8221; he commanded.
&#8220;We doan want no beggars &#8217;round
heh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson was about to flare up angrily, at the
impudent tone of this order, but when he thought
of the wretched appearance which he and George
presented he was not surprised at the coolness of
their reception. For not only were their clothes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
remarkable to look upon, but they were without
hats. Even Waggie seemed a bedraggled little
vagabond.</p>
<p>But George rose valiantly to the occasion. He
began to sing &#8220;Old Folks at Home,&#8221; in a clear
sweet voice, and, when he had finished, he gave
a spirited rendition of &#8220;Dixie.&#8221; When &#8220;Dixie&#8221;
was over he made a signal to Waggie, who
walked up and down the pathway on his hind
legs with a comical air of pride.</p>
<p>The expression of the pompous negro had
undergone a great change. His black face was
wreathed in smiles; his eyes glistened with delight;
his large white teeth shone in the morning
light like so many miniature tombstones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ya! ya! ya!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Doan go
way. Ya! ya! Look at de dog! Ho! ho!&#8221;</p>
<p>He reentered the house, but was soon back on
the portico. With him came a handsome middle-aged
man, evidently the master of the house, and
a troop of children. They were seven in all, four
girls and three boys, and they ranged in ages all
the way from five to seventeen years.</p>
<p>No sooner did he see them than George began
another song&mdash;&#8220;Nicodemus, the Slave.&#8221; This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
he followed by &#8220;Massa&#8217;s in the cold, cold ground.&#8221;
As he ended the second number the children
clapped their hands, and the master of the house
shouted &#8220;Bravo!&#8221; Then the boy proceeded to
put Waggie through his tricks. The dog rolled
over and lay flat on the ground, with his paws in
the air as if he were quite dead; then at a signal
from his master he sprang to his feet and began
to dance. He also performed many other clever
tricks that sent the children into an ecstasy of
delight. Watson nearly forgot his rôle of blind
man, more than once, in his desire to see the accomplishments
of the terrier. But he saved himself
just in time, and contrived to impart to
his usually keen eyes a dull, staring expression.</p>
<p>By the time Waggie had given his last trick
the young people had left the portico and were
crowding around him with many terms of endearment.
One of them, seizing the tiny animal
in her arms, ran with him into the house, where
he must have been given a most generous meal,
for he could eat nothing more for the next
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The handsome man came off the portico and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
looked at the two supposed beggars with an expression
of sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a nice voice, my boy,&#8221; he said,
turning to George. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you make better use
of it than this? Why don&#8217;t you join the army,
and sing to the soldiers?&#8221;</p>
<p>George might have answered that he already
belonged to one army, and did not feel like
joining another, but he naturally thought he had
better not mention this. He evaded the question,
and asked if he and the &#8220;blind man&#8221; might
have some breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you can!&#8221; said the master, very cordially.
&#8220;Here, Pompey, take these fellows
around to the kitchen and tell Black Dinah to
give them a <i>good</i> meal. And when they are
through bring them into my study. I want the
boy to sing some more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black man with the white teeth escorted
the strangers to the kitchen of the mansion,
where an ebony cook treated them to a typical
southern feast. It was well that Black Dinah
had no unusual powers of reasoning or perception,
for the beggars forgot, more than once, to
keep up their assumed rôles. Watson found no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
difficulty in eating, despite his supposed infirmity,
and George came within an inch of presenting a
Confederate bill to Madame Dinah. But he suddenly
reflected that paupers were not supposed
to &#8220;tip&#8221; servants, and he stuffed the money back
into his trousers pocket.</p>
<p>When they had finished Pompey escorted them
to the study of the master of the house. It was
a large room, filled with books and family portraits,
and in it were assembled the host (Mr.
Carter Peyton) and his children. The latter were
still engaged in petting Waggie, who began to
look a trifle bored. From the manner in which
they ruled the house it was plain that their
father was a widower. At the request of Mr.
Peyton, George sang his whole repertoire of
melodies, and the dog once more repeated his
tricks. Watson was given a seat in one corner of
the study. &#8220;It&#8217;s time we were off,&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>As Waggie finished his performance Watson
rose, and stretched out his hand towards George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be going,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered George. He was about
to say good-bye, and lead his companion to the
door, when a turbaned negress entered the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Massa Peyton, Massa Charles Jason done ride
oveh heh ta see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he here now?&#8221; asked Mr. Peyton. &#8220;Then
show him in. I wonder what&#8217;s the matter? It
is not often that Jason gets this far away from
home.&#8221; The girl retired.</p>
<p>Charles Jason! Where had the two Northerners
heard that name? Then it flashed upon them
almost at the same instant. Charles Jason was
the name of the farmer who had warned Mr.
Buckley about them. If he saw them both, and
in company with the dog, they would be under
suspicion at once.</p>
<p>George drew nearer to Watson and whispered
one word: &#8220;Danger!&#8221; He picked up Waggie
and put him in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be going,&#8221; reiterated Watson,
moving towards the door with unusual celerity
for a blind man who had found himself in an unfamiliar
apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go yet,&#8221; urged Mr. Peyton, seeking to
detain the supposed vagabonds; &#8220;I want Mr.
Jason to hear some of these plantation songs.
I&#8217;ll pay you well for your trouble, my boy&mdash;and
you can take away all the food you want.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; began George, &#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>As the last word was uttered Farmer Charles
Jason was ushered into the study. He was a
chubby little man of fifty or fifty-five, with red
hair, red face and a body which suggested the
figure of a plump sparrow&mdash;a kindly man, no
doubt, in the ordinary course of events, but the
last person on earth that the two fugitives wanted
to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this <i>is</i> a surprise,&#8221; said the master of
the house, very cordially. &#8220;It&#8217;s not often you
favor us with a visit as far down the highway as
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When a fellow has gout as much as I have
nowadays,&#8221; returned Jason, &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t get away
from home a great deal. But something important
made me come out to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing wrong, I hope?&#8221; asked Mr. Peyton.</p>
<p>George took hold of Watson&#8217;s left hand, and
edged towards the open door. But Mr. Peyton,
not waiting for Jason to answer his question,
leaped forward and barred the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows must not go until Mr. Jason has
heard those negro melodies.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Owing to the number of people in the room
(for all the children were there), Jason had not
singled out the Northerners for any attention.
But now he naturally looked at them. There
was nothing suspicious in his glance; it was
merely good-natured and patronizing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t go,&#8221; cried one of the children, a
pretty little girl of ten or eleven. &#8220;Show Mr.
Jason how the doggie can say his prayers.&#8221; She
hauled Waggie from George&#8217;s coat, and held him
in front of the farmer. George seized Waggie
and returned him to his pocket. There was an
angry flush on the boy&#8217;s face. He had no kind
feelings for pretty Miss Peyton.</p>
<p>Jason&#8217;s expression underwent a complete transformation
when he saw the dog. An idea seemed
to strike him with an unexpected but irresistible
force. The sight of the dog had changed the
whole current of his thoughts. He stared first
at Watson, and then at George, with a frown
that grew deeper and deeper. Then he turned
to Mr. Peyton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came over to tell you about the Yankee
spies who are loose in the county,&#8221; he cried
quickly, in excited tones. &#8220;One of them was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
boy with a dog. My son saw them&mdash;and I believe
this to be the lad. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The farmer got no further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, George!&#8221; suddenly shouted Watson.</p>
<p>At the back of the study there was a large
glass door leading out to the rear porch of the
house. He ran to this, found that it would not
open, and so deliberately hit some of the panes a
great blow with his foot.</p>
<p>Crash! The glass flew here and there in a
hundred pieces. The next moment the ex-blind
man had pushed through the ragged edges of the
remaining glass, and was scurrying across a garden
at the back of the house. After him tore
George. In going through the door he had cut
his cheek on one of the projecting splinters, but
in the excitement he was quite unconscious of
the fact. The children and their father stood
looking at Jason in a dazed, enquiring way.
They had not heard of the locomotive chase;
they knew nothing of Northern spies; they did
not understand that the farmer had suddenly
jumped at a very correct but startling conclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;After them!&#8221; shouted Jason. &#8220;They are
spies!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>By this time the whole house was in an uproar.
Most of the children were in tears (being
frightened out of their wits at the mention of
terrible spies), and the servants were running to
and fro wringing their hands helplessly, without
understanding exactly what had happened. Jason
tore to the broken door, broke off some more
glass with the end of the riding whip he held in
his hand, and was quickly past this bristling barrier
and out on the back porch. Mr. Peyton
was behind him.</p>
<p>At the end of the garden, nearly a hundred
yards away, was an old-fashioned hedge of box,
which had reached, in the course of many years,
a height of twelve feet or more. A little distance
beyond this box was a wood of pine-trees.
As Jason reached the porch he could see the two
Northerners fairly squeeze their way through the
hedge, and disappear on the other side. He
leaped from the porch, and started to run down
the garden. But his enemy, the gout, gave him
a warning twinge, and he was quickly outdistanced
by Mr. Peyton, who sped onward, with
several negroes at his heels.</p>
<p>The party continued down the garden until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
they reached the hedge; then they ran to the
right for a short distance, scurried through an
arched opening in the green box, and thus
reached the outskirts of the pine woods. Next
they began to search through the trees. But
not a sight of the fugitives could they obtain.
After they had tramped over the whole woods,
which covered about forty acres, they emerged
into open fields. Not a trace of the runaways!
They went back and made a fresh search among
the pines; they sent negroes in every direction;
yet the result was the same. When Mr. Peyton
returned, very hot and disgusted, to his usually
quiet study he found Charles Jason lying on the
sofa in an agony of gout. Several of the children
were near him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, papa, I hope you did <i>not</i> catch them,&#8221;
cried one of the latter. She was the little girl
who had pulled Waggie from George&#8217;s pocket.</p>
<p>Mr. Peyton laughed, in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you fallen in love with the boy who
sang, Laura?&#8221; he asked, with a twinkle in his
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Laura, indignantly, &#8220;but Mr.
Jason says they were spies&mdash;and spies are always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
hung&mdash;and I wouldn&#8217;t like to see that nice dog
hung.&#8221;</p>
<p>The father burst into a peal of merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I reckon the dog
would be pardoned&mdash;on the ground that he was
led astray by others older than himself. Anyway,
the rascals have gotten away as completely
as if they had disappeared from the face of the
earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason groaned. Whether the sound was caused
by pain, or disappointment at the escape of the
spies, or both, it would have been hard to tell.
When he was taken to his home, not until the
next day, he vowed he would never more chase
anything, be it even a chicken.</p>
<p>And where were the missing man, boy, and
dog? Much nearer to the Peyton house than
any of its inmates fancied. When Watson and
George ran down the garden their only idea was
to get as far off from the house as possible, although
they believed that they were pretty sure
to be captured in the end. Their pistols were
still useless; they did not know the geography of
the neighborhood; there were enemies everywhere.
But after they squeezed through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
hedge, they found in front of them, between the
box and the edge of the woods, a little patch of
muddy, uncultivated land, devoted to the refuse
of a farm. A trash heap, a broken plough,
empty boxes, barrels, broken china, and other
useless things betokened a sort of rustic junk-shop&mdash;a
receptacle for objects which had seen
their best days.</p>
<p>Among this collection, the quick eye of Watson
caught sight of a large molasses hogshead,
now empty and with its open end turned upwards.
He pulled George by the sleeve, pointed
to the hogshead, and then looked at the hedge,
as he said, breathlessly: &#8220;This is big enough to
hold us both; jump in&mdash;the hedge is so high they
can&#8217;t see us from the house!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no chance to say more. In a twinkling
the two had vaulted into the huge barrel,
and were fairly squatting at the bottom. Above
them was the open sky and the warm sun. Any
pursuer who chose to stand on tiptoe and look in
would have been rewarded for his pains. But
Watson calculated that no one would think of
the hogshead for the very reason that it stood out
so prominently amid all the trash of this dumping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
ground. No one, in fact, gave a thought to
the spot; it suggested nothing in the way of a
hiding-place. Once a negro who had joined the
hunt brushed by the hogshead, much to the terror
of its occupants, but he gave it no heed. A
few minutes later Mr. Peyton stopped within a
few feet of it, to speak to his white overseer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have searched the wood thoroughly,&#8221;
said the overseer, &#8220;but they are gone&mdash;that&#8217;s sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they have gotten out of the place,&#8221;
observed the master. &#8220;But they won&#8217;t get many
miles away. I want you to take the sorrel mare
and spread the alarm through the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had Mr. Peyton and his overseer
hurried away before Waggie indulged in a little
yelp, to ease his own feelings. He found things
rather cramped at the bottom of the hogshead,
to which he had been transferred from George&#8217;s
pocket; he longed to have more leeway for his
tiny legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had given that bark a minute ago,&#8221;
muttered George, &#8220;you would have betrayed us,
Master Waggie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! oh!&#8221; whispered Watson; &#8220;I am
so cramped and stiff I don&#8217;t know what will become
of me. This is the most painful experience
of the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>There would have been something amusing in
the position of the hiders if it had seemed less
dangerous. Watson was now sitting with legs
crossed, in tailor fashion; on his lap was George;
and upon George&#8217;s knee jumped Waggie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting tired too soon,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;We will be here some time yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was quite right, for it was not until dusk
that they dared leave their curious refuge.
Sometimes they stood up, when they got absolutely
desperate, and had it not been that the tall
hedge protected him, the head of Watson would
assuredly have been seen from the Peyton mansion.
At last they cautiously abandoned the
hogshead, and crept into the pines in front of
them. When it was pitch dark the fugitives
pushed forward in a northwestwardly direction,
until they reached a log cabin, at a distance of
about four miles from their point of departure.
Within the place a light was cheerily burning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we knock at the door?&#8221; asked Watson,
in some doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very hungry,&#8221; laughed George. &#8220;I think
I could risk knocking anywhere&mdash;if I could only
get something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we might as well be hung for sheep as
lambs,&#8221; observed Watson. &#8220;Let us try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had begun to think that it was only the
question of a few hours before he and George
would be in the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>They knocked at the door. It was half opened
by a long, lanky man, with a scraggy chin-beard,
who looked like the customary pictures of
&#8220;Uncle Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked the travelers. There
was a sound of voices within.</p>
<p>Was it prudent to play the blind man once
again? Or had this fellow heard of the excitement
at the Peyton mansion? Watson bethought
himself of a method of finding out
whether or not he should be endowed with
sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we anywhere near Squire Peyton&#8217;s?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout four miles off, or five miles by the road
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
along the creek,&#8221; said this Southern &#8220;Uncle
Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know if he&#8217;s living at his place
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was there three days ago, whan I driv
over ta sell him some shotes,&#8221; returned &#8220;Uncle
Sam.&#8221; &#8220;Reckon he must be there still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; thought Watson; &#8220;this fellow
hasn&#8217;t heard anything about the Peyton <i>fracas</i>.
I&#8217;ll lose my sight once again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clutched George&#8217;s hand in a helpless fashion,
and poured forth a tale of woe. He was
blind and poor, he said; he and his nephew
(meaning George) were in need of food and
shelter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sing for you,&#8221; said George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tarnation pumpkins,&#8221; cried Uncle Sam; &#8220;I
hate squalin&#8217;. But come in. I never shut my
door on anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the door the whole way. The two
Northerners and the dog walked into the dazzling
light made by a great wood-fire&mdash;and confronted
five Confederate soldiers and an officer
who were toasting their feet at the hearth!
They all glanced at the newcomers, who dearly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
regretted, when too late, that they had entered.
The officer stared first at Watson and then at
George with the air of a man who is searching
for some one. Uncle Sam introduced them to
the party in a manner more vigorous than polite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a couple o&#8217; beggars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ma,
get &#8217;em somethin&#8217; to eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma,&#8221; who was his wife, came bustling out of
the second room, or kitchen, of the cabin. She
was red in the face, and of generous proportions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, pop,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;do you expect
me to cook for a hotel? I&#8217;ve just been feedin&#8217;
these soldiers, and now you want me to get
victuals for beggars.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the plump hostess saw the blind man,
the boy and the dog, her face softened. She
went back to the kitchen, and soon returned
with some coarse but highly acceptable food,
which was gratefully eaten by George and Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you two tramp through the country together?&#8221;
asked the officer. He was addressed
by his men as Captain Harris. Every line and
feature of his clean-shaven face denoted shrewdness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Watson. &#8220;My nephew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
sings&mdash;the dog has some tricks&mdash;we make a little
money&mdash;even in war time.&#8221; He would put the
best face possible on this trying situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no home?&#8221; went on the officer, in
a sympathetic voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from before you took
to begging?&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson hesitated for a second. Then he said:
&#8220;Lynchburg, Virginia.&#8221; It was the only place
he could think of at that moment, and it seemed
far enough off to be safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent three weeks in Lynchburg last year,&#8221;
said Captain Harris. &#8220;What part of the town
did you live in?&#8221;</p>
<p>This time George came to the rescue. &#8220;On
Main Street,&#8221; he answered. He had known a
boy in Cincinnati whose mother had once resided
in Lynchburg, and he had heard the lad speak of
a Main Street in that town.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Main Street,&#8221; repeated the Captain.
Was the look that passed quickly across his face
one of surprise or disappointment?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, on Main Street,&#8221; asserted George. He
felt very sure of himself now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How near were you to the Sorrel Horse
Hotel?&#8221; asked the Captain, after a brief
pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;About two streets away, eh George?&#8221; said
Watson. He had, very naturally, never heard
of the Sorrel Horse, and he knew nothing of
Lynchburg, but it would be fatal to show any
ignorance on the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, just about two streets away,&#8221; agreed
the boy.</p>
<p>The men were all sitting near the blazing fire.
Suddenly Captain Harris, without saying a word,
lifted his right arm and sent his fist flying towards
the face of Watson, who sat near him.
With an exclamation of anger Watson jumped
to his feet, just in time to avoid the blow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he cried, as he glared
at his antagonist.</p>
<p>The Captain smiled. He did not seem at all
pugnacious now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;that I have proved
my suspicions to be true. I thought you were
not blind&mdash;and I find that you still have enough
sight left to see a blow when it is coming to
you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>Watson could cheerfully have whipped himself
for his blunder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further,&#8221; went on the officer, in a politely
taunting tone that was very provoking, &#8220;I find
that neither you nor the boy ever lived in Lynchburg,
for the simple reason that there is no Sorrel
Horse Hotel in that place, and there never was!&#8221;</p>
<p>How nicely had he planned this little trap!
And how foolish the two fugitives felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, my dear beggars,&#8221; went on the
Captain, in the same ironical vein, &#8220;allow me to
say that I don&#8217;t believe you are beggars at all.
I strongly suspect that you are members of this
engine-stealing expedition which has come to
grief. This afternoon I was sent out from
Chattanooga, among others, to scour the country,
and it will be my duty to march you there to-morrow
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause painful in its intensity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have either of you got anything to say?&#8221;
demanded the Captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We admit nothing!&#8221; said Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised,&#8221; answered the Captain.
&#8220;Your offense is a hanging one. But you were
a plucky lot&mdash;that&#8217;s certain.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>FINAL TRIALS</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning Watson and George Knight,
with the faithful Waggie (who was destined to
remain with his master throughout all these adventures,
in which he had played his own little
part), were taken by the detachment of Confederates
to Chattanooga. Here they were
placed in the jail, and here also, in the course of
a few days, were brought Andrews and the
other members of the ill-fated expedition. For
they were all captured, sooner or later, as might
have been expected. The whole South rang
with the story of the engine chase, and every
effort was made to track and capture the courageous
Northerners.</p>
<p>After a stay of several weeks in Chattanooga
the party were taken by railroad to Madison, in
Georgia, for it was feared that General Mitchell
was about to take possession of the former place.
In a few days, however, when the danger had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
passed, they were returned to Chattanooga. It
was not until September of 1863 that this city
fell into the hands of a Union force.</p>
<p>Of the movements and separation of the
prisoners after their return to Chattanooga, or
of the experiences of some of them in Knoxville,
it is not necessary to make detailed mention.
Andrews, after a trial, was executed in Atlanta
as a spy, dying like a brave man, and seven of
his companions, condemned by a court-martial,
shared the same fate. It was the fortune of
war. George could never dance, as he had
promised, at his leader&#8217;s wedding.</p>
<p>Let us change the scene to the city prison of
Atlanta, where the remaining fourteen members
of the expedition were to be found in the following
October. Among them were Watson,
George Knight, Jenks and Macgreggor. Waggie,
too, was still in evidence, but he would have
found life rather dreary had not the kind-hearted
jailer allowed one of his family to take the dog
many a scamper around the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Andrews,&#8221; said Watson, one afternoon,
&#8220;it is hard to realize that he and seven others
of us have gone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>The party were occupying a well-barred room
on the second floor of the prison. This second
floor comprised four rooms for prisoners, two on
each side of a hallway. In the hallway was a
staircase which led to the first story, where the
jailer and his family had their quarters. Outside
the building was a yard surrounded by a
fence about nine feet high, and here and there a
soldier, fully armed, was on guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be doleful, boys,&#8221; said Macgreggor,
&#8220;but I think we will soon follow
Andrews. As the days rolled on and we heard
no more of any trial or execution I began to
hope that the Confederate Government had forgotten
the rest of us. I even thought it possible
we might be exchanged for the same number of
Confederates in Northern prisons, and thus allowed
to go back to our army. But I&#8217;ve kept
my eyes and ears open&mdash;and I have now become
anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; asked George. The boy looked
thin and very pale, after his long confinement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard some one&mdash;I think it was the Provost-Marshal&mdash;talking
to the jailer this morning, at
the front door of the prison. I was looking out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
of the window; you fellows were all playing
games. &#8216;Keep a very strict eye on those engine-stealers,&#8217;
the marshal said; &#8216;a court is going to
try them&mdash;and you know what that means&mdash;death!
A trial will be nothing more than a
formality, for the whole fourteen of them are
spies, under the rules of war. They were soldiers
who entered the enemy&#8217;s line in civilian disguise.
So don&#8217;t let them get away.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Macgreggor&#8217;s listeners stirred uneasily. This
was not what might be called pleasant news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell us before?&#8221; asked
Jenks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t the heart to,&#8221; returned Macgreggor.
&#8220;You boys were all so cheerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson cleared his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what it is, boys,&#8221; he whispered, as
he gave Waggie a mournful pat; &#8220;if we don&#8217;t
want to be buried in an Atlanta graveyard we
must escape!&#8221;</p>
<p>George&#8217;s white face flushed at the thought.
The idea of liberty was dazzling, after so many
weary days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said one of the men, in the same low
tone, &#8220;it&#8217;s better to escape, and run the risk of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
failing or of being re-captured, than to rot here
until we are led out to be hanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s invent a plan that will enable us not
only to get out, but to <i>stay</i> out,&#8221; laughed Jenks.</p>
<p>There was dead silence for nearly ten minutes.
The men, who had been sitting on the floor
watching two of their number at a game of
checkers, were deep in thought. At last Watson
opened his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a plan,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Tell me
what you think of it. You know that about
sunset the darkies come into the rooms to leave
us our supper. The jailer stands outside. Then,
later, the jailer comes and takes away the dishes.
He is then alone. Suppose we seize him, gag
him, take his keys, unlock all the doors on this
floor, and release all the prisoners. As you know,
there are a number besides our own party&mdash;whites
and negroes. All this must be quietly
done, however, if it is to prove successful. Then
we can go down-stairs, without making any
noise, overpower the seven sentinels, take their
guns, and make off, after locking up these gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson went further into details, to show the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
probable workings of his scheme. It was finally
agreed that the dash was well worth the trial.
As Jenks remarked: &#8220;It&#8217;s either that or a few
feet of cold rope, and a coffin!&#8221;</p>
<p>The late afternoon of the next day was fixed
upon for the escape. In addition to the fourteen
remaining adventurers, a Union captain from
East Tennessee, who shared the room with them,
was to be associated in this daring enterprise. It
seemed to George as if the hour would never
come; but as the sun began to sink gradually
towards the horizon on the following afternoon
he realized, from the feverish restlessness of the
whole party, that there was not much longer to
wait.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep up your nerve, fellows,&#8221; said Watson,
who had become the leader of the party, &#8220;and
remember that all depends upon the quietness
with which we conduct things on this floor, so
that the guard below won&#8217;t take the alarm.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke there was a rattling of keys and a
creaking of locks. The heavy door of the room
opened, and in walked Waggie. He had been
having a walk, with a daughter of the jailer, and
one of the negro servants had taken him up-stairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
and unlocked the door. The next moment the
key was turned; the prisoners were again shut
in from the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little Waggie,&#8221; said Macgreggor. &#8220;Is
he going too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken him through too much to leave
him behind now,&#8221; said George fondly. &#8220;Look.
This is as good as a kennel.&#8221; He pointed to an
overcoat, which the East Tennessee Captain had
given him, and showed on one side a large
pocket. The side of the latter was buttoned up
closely to the coat.</p>
<p>The minutes dragged along. Finally Watson
said, with a sort of mournful impressiveness:
&#8220;Boys, let us all bid each other good-bye. For
some of us may never meet again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The men clasped one another by the hand. In
the eyes of most of them were tears&mdash;not timid
tears, but the tears of soldiers who had become
attached to one another through suffering and
hoping together. It was a solemn scene which
the rays of the dying sun illumined, and George
would never forget it.</p>
<p>Watson brushed a drop from his cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel better, now,&#8221; he said cheerfully; &#8220;I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
ready for anything. Remember one thing.
Treat the jailer as gently as possible. He has
been a kind fellow where some would have been
the reverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; murmured his companions. It was an
order which had their hearty sympathy.</p>
<p>In a little while there was the long-expected
creaking at the door. It was supper time! Two
negroes entered and placed some pans containing
food upon the table. Then they retired, and the
door was locked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat, boys,&#8221; whispered Watson; &#8220;we don&#8217;t
know when we may get our next square
meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men soon disposed of the food. Hardly
had they finished before the door was thrown
open, and the jailer, an elderly, bearded man,
appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, men,&#8221; he said, in a pleasant,
unsuspicious voice. He halted at the doorway
with the keys in his right hand.</p>
<p>It was a terrible moment. George felt as if he
were living ten years in that one instant.</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, sir,&#8221; said Watson, approaching
the jailer. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a very pleasant evening
that we intend to take a little walk.&#8221; He
threw back the door as he spoke.</p>
<p>The jailer was unprepared for this move. He
did not even divine what was intended.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&mdash;what do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had enough of prison life,&#8221; said Macgreggor,
in a calm, even voice, &#8220;and we are going
to leave you. Now give up the keys, and keep
very quiet, or you&#8217;ll find&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep off!&#8221; cried the jailer, as he tightened
his hold on the bunch of keys. He was about to
call for help, but Watson placed his left hand
over the man&#8217;s mouth, and with his right
clutched the unfortunate&#8217;s throat. Then Macgreggor
seized the keys, after a sharp but decisive
struggle, and hurried into the hallway,
where he began to release the general prisoners.
He quickly unlocked in succession the doors of
the three other rooms on the second floor. The
men thus freed did not understand the significance
of it all, but they saw unexpected liberty
staring them in the face, and they ran out of
their quarters like so many sheep.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the members of the engine expedition,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
with the exception of Watson and Macgreggor,
had run almost noiselessly down the
staircase, through the jailer&#8217;s quarters on the
first floor, and thus out into the prison yard.
Some of them threw themselves upon the three
soldiers in the rear of the yard, wrenched from
them their muskets, crying out at the same time:
&#8220;Make a movement or a cry and we&#8217;ll shoot you
down!&#8221; The rest of the party, among whom
were George Knight and Jenks, tore into the
front part of the yard, where four guards were
patroling near the main door of the jail. Two
of these guards were quickly disarmed. But the
other two, seeing the oncoming of the prisoners,
ran out of the gate of the picket fence, uttering
loud cries as they went. Their escape was entirely
unexpected.</p>
<p>The general prisoners now came tumbling into
the yard, headed by Watson and Macgreggor.
Watson, warned that there was no time to lose,
had released his hold upon the astonished jailer.
He did not know that two of the sentinels had
escaped, but he arrived down-stairs just in time
to see the result of their disappearance. A large
reserve guard of Confederates, warned of the jail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
delivery by these two soldiers, came rushing
madly into the yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out, boys!&#8221; cried Watson. Other
members of the engine party, seeing the arrival
of the troops, released the five remaining sentinels,
threw down their newly acquired muskets,
and began to scale the prison fence. There came
the sharp crack of rifles from the reserve guard.
Whiz! The bullets rattled all around the heads
of the fence-climbers, the whistling noise having
for accompaniment the cries of the angry Confederates.
Whiz! Another volley! Yet no one
was hit. On the fugitives went, as they descended
on the other side of the fence, and made
for some woods at a distance of nearly a mile
from the prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;After &#8217;em, men,&#8221; came the word of command
to the Confederates. Soldiers were running
hither and thither, while the general prisoners,
who had been released by Macgreggor, were soon
safely housed in their old rooms. The bullets
were flying thick and fast within and without
the prison yard; the scene was one of pandemonium.
Ere long five of the engine party had been
captured, three inside of the yard and two immediately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
outside. Among these were Jenks and
Macgreggor who were both uninjured, but both
very much disheartened. Soon there was the
clatter of hoofs, and a troop of cavalry dashed
up to the front of the jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more chance of escape!&#8221; said Jenks bitterly,
as he looked out of the barred window.
He could hear the cavalry colonel excitedly
crying: &#8220;Hunt down the fellows till you have
every one of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope some of the boys will get off,&#8221; remarked
Macgreggor. &#8220;Any one who is captured
is sure to be hung now.&#8221; Afterwards another
prisoner was captured. There were now six of
the party back in jail.</p>
<p>Where were Watson and George during this
escapade? No sooner had the former cried out
his warning, on the approach of the reserve
guard, than he made directly for George, who
was in the back part of the yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said, in tones of suppressed excitement,
&#8220;over the fence with us. It&#8217;s our only
chance&mdash;now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Imitating the example of others the man and
boy were soon balanced on top of the wooden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
fence. Whirr! George was conscious of a
whistling sound, and a bullet flew by him as it
just grazed the tip of one ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; urged Watson. In another
second the two had dropped from the fence and
were running like mad over a large field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; cried some voices behind them.
Looking back they could see that about a dozen
soldiers were in hot pursuit. A ball sped by
George, dangerously near the capacious pocket
in which Waggie was ensconced; a second bullet
would have ended the life of Watson had it come
an inch nearer the crown of his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;These men are
fresh&mdash;we are weakened by imprisonment&mdash;they
will get up to us in the end. Let&#8217;s try a trick.
The next time the bullets come we&#8217;ll drop as if
we were dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment another volley rattled around
and over them. Watson threw up his arms, as
if in agony, and sank on the grass. George
uttered a loud cry, and went down within a few
feet of his companion.</p>
<p>All but one of the Confederates halted, upon
seeing the apparent success of their aim, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
turned to pursue in a new direction. The remaining
soldier came running up to the two
prisoners, and after taking one look which convinced
him that they were either dead or dying
he scurried back to rejoin his detachment. There
was no use in wasting time over corpses when
living enemies remained to be caught.</p>
<p>The &#8220;corpses&#8221; waited until all was quiet
around them. Then they arose, and kept on
towards the woods. These they reached when
darkness had fallen upon the trees&mdash;a circumstance
which aided them in one way, as it lessened
the danger of pursuit. But in another way
the night impeded their progress for they could
not get their bearings. They groped from tree
to tree, and from bush to bush, like blind men.
Once they heard a great rustling, and were convinced
that it was caused by some of their companions,
but they dared not speak, for fear of a
mistake. At last they stumbled out upon a deserted
highroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we?&#8221; whispered George.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Watson. &#8220;Hark!
Do you hear anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sound, at first very faint, became more and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
more distinct as they listened. Galloping
horsemen and the rattle of sabres proclaimed the
approach of cavalry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back into the woods,&#8221; urged Watson. &#8220;We
may be putting ourselves in a trap&mdash;but for the
life of me I don&#8217;t know where else to
go!&#8221;</p>
<p>They hurried into the wood, where they
crawled under a scrubby pine bush, and anxiously
awaited the outcome. On rushed the horsemen
until they reached the outskirts of the wood.
Here they halted. The hiders under the pine
bush could hear one of the officers say: &#8220;The
infantry will soon be here to relieve us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a great time to-night,&#8221; growled
another officer. &#8220;These Yankees, not content
with troubling us on the battle-field, must even
stir things up when they are prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder those locomotive-stealers
wanted to escape,&#8221; laughed the first officer.
&#8220;They know what the punishment of a spy
always is.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes a company of infantry
marched to the scene. After a short conference
between their officers and those of the cavalry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
the horsemen galloped away. The infantry were
now formed into squads, and sent to keep guard
in the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are getting rather warm!&#8221; whispered
Watson. George murmured an assent. Well
might he do so, for a sentry had soon been
posted within fifty feet of the two fugitives.
The situation was fraught with the greatest
danger. Watson and George realized that the
soldiers would patrol the woods until morning,
when discovery would be inevitable.</p>
<p>Watson sank his voice so low that it could just
be heard by his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to stay here until daylight,&#8221;
he whispered. &#8220;We must wriggle out of here
until we come to the edge of the road. Then we
must make a break and run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run where?&#8221; asked George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providence alone knows,&#8221; answered Watson.
&#8220;We must trust to chance. But anything is
better than remaining here, to be caught like
rabbits by dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; replied George. He already
saw himself back in the Atlanta prison, and he
even pictured himself with a rope around his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
neck; but he was prepared for any adventure,
whatever might be the result.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner the better,&#8221; whispered Watson.
Without any more words the two began to
wriggle along the ground and kept up this snake-like
motion until they reached the edge of the
wood. It was slow work and very tiresome, but
it was their one chance of escape. Then they
stood up, and bounded across the highroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go!&#8221; shouted one of the soldiers
in the wood. At once there was an uproar, as
the sentries ran out into the road, and began to
fire their guns in wild confusion. It was pitch
dark, and they could see nothing. Over the road
and into an open field tore the two fugitives.
They felt like blind men, for they could hardly
distinguish any object before them; moreover
they were wholly ignorant of their surroundings.
They ran on, however, and finally reached another
field in which were several large trees.
Watson made straight for one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up we go,&#8221; he said, and, suiting the action to
the order, he had soon clambered up the tree,
and seated himself across one of its branches.
George was quick to follow; he climbed up with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
even more celerity than Watson, and settled himself
on a neighboring branch.</p>
<p>They could hear the cries of the sentries,
mingled with an occasional shot. Two of the
soldiers passed directly under the tree occupied
by the Northerners.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have gotten off,&#8221; one of them was saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised,&#8221; rejoined the other sentry.
&#8220;Any fellows who could do what they did at
Big Shanty are not easy customers to deal
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a little while the two sentries returned,
and, again passing under the tree, evidently
went back to the woods. The uproar had
ceased; there was no more firing; it was plain
that the chase had been abandoned.</p>
<p>After the lapse of half an hour Watson and
George descended from their uncomfortable
perches. Once upon the ground the boy released
Waggie from his pocket, and the little
party pushed on in the darkness for about a mile.
Here they found a hayrick in a field, alongside of
which they laid their weary bones and slept the
sleep of exhaustion. When daylight came they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
had awakened, feeling much refreshed and ready
for more adventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I think,&#8221; said Watson.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a chance for us yet, provided we try a
new means of getting away from the South.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked George.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we try to move northward,&#8221; continued
Watson, &#8220;we are sure to be caught. Every
countryman between Atlanta and Chattanooga
will be on the lookout for us. Instead of that,
let us strike out towards the Gulf of Mexico,
where we should reach one of the ships of the
Union blockading squadron. New Orleans is in
the hands of the North, and many of our vessels
must be patroling the Gulf. Once we reach the
coast we are practically free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; cried the boy. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
genius!&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a genius,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I have what
they call horse-sense up our way&mdash;and I&#8217;m not
anxious to return to the delights of the Atlanta
prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acting upon this new theory the wanderers
began their long journey. This they pursued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
amid many hardships, not the least of which
was hunger. Even poor Waggie grew emaciated.
First they reached the banks of the
Chattahoochee River, after which they secured
a boat and rowed their way down via the
Apalachicola River, to Apalachicola, Florida, on
the Gulf of Mexico. Here they found, to their
great delight, that a Federal blockading squadron
was patroling on the Gulf, near the mouth of
Apalachicola Bay.</p>
<p>The two fugitives now pushed their little boat
out into the open sea. They were a sorry looking
couple, with their old clothes fairly dropping
from them, and their thin, gaunt figures showing
the consequences of many days of privation.
Watson was feverish, with an unnatural glitter
in his eyes, while George&#8217;s face was a sickly
white. Waggie reposed at the bottom of the
rickety craft, as if he cared not whether he lived
or died.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Watson, who was at the oars.
He pointed out towards the south, where were to
be seen a collection of masts and smoke-stacks,
rising above long black hulls.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Federal fleet,&#8221; said George. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
glad to have a look at it&mdash;glad to know that
deliverance was at hand&mdash;but he felt too exhausted
to put any enthusiasm into his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see any flag?&#8221; he asked, wearily.
&#8220;Perhaps we have been fooled after all. The
ships may belong to the Confederate navy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon they could detect, as they drew nearer, a
flutter of bunting from the vessel nearest to
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the old flag!&#8221; cried George, jumping
from his seat in the stern with a precipitancy
that threatened to upset the boat. &#8220;See the blue&mdash;and
the red and white stripes! Hurrah!&#8221;
But he was too weak for much enthusiasm even
now and he soon had to sit down once more.</p>
<p>Watson uttered a cry which was meant to be
triumphant, although it came like a hoarse croak
from his parched throat. Then the tears gushed
into his eyes as he gazed again upon the flag. It
almost seemed as if he were home again.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer they rowed to the squadron.
There were four ships of war, and now they
could see the sailors walking the decks and the
guns in the portholes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there in ten minutes now,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Watson, &#8220;and I think I can eat a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
gasped and failed to finish the sentence. He
half rose from his seat, relinquished the oars,
with a despairing cry, and then, losing all consciousness,
pitched over the gunwale into the
sunlit waters of the Gulf.</p>
<p>George jumped up from the stern and stretched
out his arm to seize the inanimate body of his
friend. But the movement was too much for the
equilibrium of the frail boat and for the balance
of the boy. Out into the water shot George,
overturning the craft until its keel was in the air.</p>
<p>George struck out for Watson and succeeded
in grabbing him by the hair of his head just as
he was about to disappear beneath the waves.
Then he changed his hold upon the man, and
with his left hand clutching the neck of Watson&#8217;s
coat he pulled to the side of the upturned boat.
To this he held with his right hand like grim
death, as he put his left arm around Watson&#8217;s
waist. The boy was panting for breath, and as
weak as if he had been swimming for miles.
Not until now had he thoroughly realized how
hunger, exposure and privation had done their
work. The next instant he felt a gentle paddling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
near him; he looked down and there was
Waggie&#8217;s wet but plucky little face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! old boy,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I would
rather drown myself than see you go under. So
here goes!&#8221;</p>
<p>He released his hold of Watson and by a quick
movement swung Waggie to the upturned bottom
of the boat, near the keel. The tiny animal
gave a bark that said &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; as plainly
as if he had spelled out every letter of the two
words. George again seized Watson and clung
to the boat more tightly than before. The
soldier gradually came back to consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I done?&#8221; he asked, staring
wildly at the hot sun above him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; answered George. &#8220;Only try to
hold on to the boat. For I&#8217;m so worn out that
it&#8217;s all I can do to keep myself up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson clawed frantically at the gunwale.
At last he managed to grasp it with his tired,
bony fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hold on much longer!&#8221; suddenly said
George, in a faint voice. His hands were numb;
he felt as if he had not one particle of strength
left in his emaciated body. His mind began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
wander. He forgot that he was in the Gulf of
Mexico; he thought he was holding on to a
horse. By and by the horse began to move.
Could he keep his grasp on the animal? No;
not much longer. The horse started to canter,
and the boy felt himself slipping backward. In
reality he had let go his hold upon the boat. So,
too, had Watson. The next moment was a
blank. The sun came burning down on poor
Waggie, perched on top of the craft, as he
growled piteously at the sight of master and
friend drifting helplessly away.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When George recovered his senses he was lying
on the deck of one of the war-vessels, and
Waggie was barking in an effort to awaken him.
Near him sat Watson, with a happy smile on his
wan face. Around him was a group of officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; one of the latter was saying.
&#8220;Those poor fellows had a narrow escape. It
was well we saw their plight and sent a boat
after them. It got there just in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my boys,&#8221; asked an older officer (who
was evidently the captain of the vessel), in a
gruff but not unkindly tone, &#8220;what on earth <i>are</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
you, and where did you come from? You
don&#8217;t appear to have been gorging yourselves
lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>When George and Watson were a little
stronger they told the story of their adventures,
in brief but graphic terms, to the interested
group of officers. When they had finished the
Captain came up to them, and put a hand upon
the shoulder of each.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows want a good round meal!&#8221; he
said emphatically. &#8220;And after that some
clothes will not come amiss, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this they readily assented. How delicious
the food tasted when it was served to them at
the officers&#8217; mess; and how comfortable but
strange they felt when, an hour later, they
were arrayed in all the glory of clean underclothes,
shoes, nice suits and naval caps. When
they came on deck again, how the sailors did
cheer. And Waggie! How fine and cheerful he
looked, to be sure, all decked out in ribbons provided
by the tars; and how pleased he felt with
the whole world since he had eaten&mdash;but it would
take too long to detail the <i>menu</i> with which the
dog had been regaled. The wonder was that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
survived the spoiling that he received during the
next four days.</p>
<p>At the end of that time he accompanied his
master and Watson, who were sent on a government
vessel to New York. From New York
they traveled by rail to Washington, where they
were to relate their experiences, and the result of
the railroad chase, to President Lincoln.</p>
<p>First they saw Mr. Stanton, the Secretary of
War, who made them dine and spend the night
as his guests, and who the next morning took
them to the White House. George trembled
when he was ushered into the private office of
Mr. Lincoln. He felt nervous at the thought of
encountering the man who, more than any one
else, held in his hand the destiny of the nation.
But, when a tall, gaunt person, with wonderful,
thoughtful eyes and a homely face, illumined by
a melancholy but attractive smile, walked up to
him and asked: &#8220;Is this George Knight?&#8221; all
the boy&#8217;s timidity vanished. As he answered,
&#8220;Yes, I am George Knight,&#8221; he felt as if he had
known the President for years.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln listened to the narrative of the
two fugitives&mdash;now fugitives no longer&mdash;and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
to them many questions. When the recital was
over the President asked: &#8220;Do you know that
poor General Mitchell has died from yellow
fever?&#8221;</p>
<p>They answered in the affirmative, for Mr.
Stanton had given them this unwelcome information
upon their arrival in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln pulled a paper from one of the
pockets of his ill-fitting black coat and handed it
to Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a commission for you as a Captain in
the regular army,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I know of
no one who could deserve it more than Captain
Watson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I ever thank you, Mr. President?&#8221;
cried Watson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thanks are all on my side,&#8221; answered the
President, smiling. &#8220;That reminds me of a little
story. When&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton, who was standing immediately
behind his chief, began to cough in a curious,
unnatural way.</p>
<p>A gleam of humor came into the unfathomable
eyes of the President.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Stanton never appreciates my stories,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
he said, quizzically, &#8220;and when he coughs that
way I know what he means.&#8221; Then, turning to
George, he continued: &#8220;My lad, you are one of
the heroes of the war! I had intended giving
you, too, a commission, but I find you are too
young. But I suppose you want to see more of
the war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do, Mr. Lincoln!&#8221; cried George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since poor Mitchell is dead, how would
you like to go as a volunteer aid on the staff of
one of our generals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; said the boy, with
ardor.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln faced his Secretary of War.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t always let me have my own way,
Mr. Secretary,&#8221; he observed, dryly, &#8220;but I think
you must oblige me in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s pretty young,&#8221; answered the Secretary,
&#8220;but I fancy it can be arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said the President. &#8220;And now,
George, if you behave with half the pluck in the
future that you have shown in the past, I&#8217;ll have
no fear for you. Do your duty, and some day
you may live to see&mdash;as I may not live to see&mdash;a
perfect reunion between North and South; for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
God surely does not intend that one great people
shall divide into two separate nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>George left the White House in a perfect glow
of enthusiasm. The very next day he was ordered
to join the staff of General George H.
Thomas, and he joyfully obeyed the summons to
leave Washington. His only regret was in parting
from Waggie, whom he was obliged to entrust
to the care of a friend of Secretary Stanton&#8217;s.
The boy saw plenty of army life throughout
the rest of the war. When the conflict was
over he hurried back to Washington, found
Waggie alive and well, and then went home with
him to Cincinnati. Here he had a startling but
delightful reunion with his father, whose mysterious
disappearance had been due to his capture by
the Confederates, and an incarceration for many
months in an out-of-the-way Southern prison.</p>
<p>There were many things of interest which
George did not learn until after the last gun of
the war had been fired. One was that Watson
had made a brilliant record for himself as a regular
army officer, and had come out of the war
with a sound skin and the rank of Colonel.
Another piece of news concerned the fortunes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the soldiers who escaped from the Atlanta jail.
Eight of the engine party and the East Tennessee
Captain (this number including Watson and
George), managed to escape, and finally reached
the Northern lines in safety. The six prisoners
who were recaptured, among them Macgreggor
and Jenks, escaped hanging, and were exchanged
for the same number of Southern prisoners.
Jenks was killed at the battle of Gettysburg;
Macgreggor served through the war, was honorably
discharged as a Major of Volunteers, and
finally developed into a successful physician in
the growing city of Chicago.</p>
<p>Waggie has been gathered to his canine forefathers
these many years. But it is comforting
to reflect that he lived to a fine old age, and died
full of honors. He was known far and wide as
the &#8220;Civil War Dog&#8221;&mdash;a title which caused him
to receive much attention, and a good many
dainty bits of food in addition to his regular
meals. Let it be added, however, that his digestion
and his bright disposition remained unimpaired
until the end.</p>
<p>George Knight is now a prosperous merchant,
happily married, and living in St. Louis. He is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
proud in the possession of a son who saw active
service in the Spanish-American War as an officer
in the navy. Before we say good-bye to our hero
let us record that he never forgot the kindness
of the Rev. Mr. Buckley, who had saved his life
as a boy. Many a Christmas-time gift testified
to the gratitude of the Northerner.</p>
<p>In the desk in George Knight&#8217;s office is a bundle
of letters from the old clergyman. The last of
these to be received reads as follows:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Friend George</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Christmas Day&mdash;the last, I am
sure, that I will ever see. I am too feeble to
write you more than my best wishes for the holiday
season, and to say&mdash;Thank God, the war has
been over these twenty years and we are once
more a united nation. No North, no South, no
East, no West&mdash;but simply America. I have
been spared to see this&mdash;and I am grateful.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:5em;'>&#8220;Cordially yours,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Amos Buckley</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' margin-top:2em;'>THE END</p>
